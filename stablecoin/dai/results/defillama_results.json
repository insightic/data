                "headline": "This layer 2 is the biggest winner from Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade so far",
                "keypoints": "Base's user metrics soared following the Dencun upgrade, achieving record low transaction costs and an all-time high of 855,000 daily active users.\nThe upgrade slashed Base transaction fees by 99.9% from the fees on Ethereum.\nThe upcoming Coinbase smart wallet may further boost Base's growth by making it easier for users to gain access to decentralised apps and assets.",
                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin\u2019s price fell to an 11-day low on Sunday at $64,450, a more than 12% drop from a high earlier this month.\nOne analyst notes two factors that will drive Bitcoin\u2019s price: corporate filings and the potential approval of options on Bitcoin ETFs.",
                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin ETF frenzy means this halving will be different",
                "keypoints": "Coinbase analysts say Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event is different this time.\nPrior halving events have witnessed heightened volatility as Bitcoin supply struggled to meet demand.\nAnalysts point to increased liquidity from spot Bitcoin ETFs as a foundation for sustained growth.",
                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "headline": "DeFi exchange dYdX attracts stakers amid $41bn in trading volume",
                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "headline": "AI hype in crypto pushes Bittensor subnet fees by 10,000%",
                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "headline": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade will make DeFi a lot cheaper to use",
                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun. (Metrika) VOTE: Aave to add GMX\u2019s gmETH to its Arbitrum liquidity pool VOTE: Jupiter DAO concludes vote on LFG launchpad candidates VOTE: Arbitrum votes on new $4 million grants programme Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin slaps back at an X user complaining about high transaction fees. Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " Bitcoin surged past $71,000 on Monday morning, London time, breaking its own record for the fourth time in a week. The new record comes as the cryptocurrency is starting to drive inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to an analyst \u2014 not the other way around. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been attributed as a key driver behind the digital asset\u2019s recovery this year, but the head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX says that relationship is about to change. \u201cIf until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\u201d David Lawant posted on Thursday. The market is now entering a phase where Lawant expects to see more reflexivity, he added. Reflexivity refers to a feedback loop where market trends and the fundamentals influencing them can enhance each other. In this case, it would translate to the Bitcoin price soaring, which would then drive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would drive the price higher. Bitcoin broke its November 2021 all-time high three times over the past week: on Tuesday, Friday, and over the weekend, breaking the $69,100, $69,200, and $70,000 barrier, respectively. However, a more dramatic price hike may take a while, Lawant said. \u201cIf the past cycle is any guide, we might hover around the current levels for a while before decisively breaking into a new inning of the bull market trend,\u201d Lawant said. \u201cAll market signals so far indicate that the current bull market trend remains in place.\u201d On Tuesday, US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the spot market saw their largest daily net inflows since they began trading on January 11 at $648 million, according to Bitwise.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Bitcoin price may be settling, but more volatility is on the way, analysts warn",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has settled following a severe dip earlier in the week.\nAnalysts say the calm is allowing the market to play catch-up.\nStill, more volatility is coming, they warn.",
                "body": " Bitcoin has sailed into calmer waters since the biggest daily decline in almost two months on Tuesday, which saw its price surge to an all-time high of $69,100, before dipping 14%. The plunge triggered $1.2 billion in liquidations, resulting in the second-most challenging day for traders since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Now, traders have a chance to collect themselves as more volatility looms on the horizon, analysts say. Rather than causing market-wide panic, analysts and experts say the move was necessary for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term outlook as exchange-traded funds continue to prop up demand. \u201cOver the past 24 hours, the BTC price has been holding relatively steady, and its trading patterns seem quieter,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of market insights at Genesis and author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, said on Thursday. The asset is trading at $67,500, up 0.9% on the day. Following Bitcoin\u2019s recovery back above $66,000 on Wednesday, its price has been trading within a range of about 4.8%. The calm gives the market room to breathe while investors reassess their positions and strategies, Acheson said. \u201cIt also sets the stage for the next trend, which \u2014 given the relative strength of the tailwinds \u2014 is likely to be up,\u201d she said. The moves were necessary to flush out exuberance in derivatives and restore investor confidence, analysts told DL News following this week\u2019s severe price swings. \u201cWhenever excess leverage builds in a system, it needs a blow-off valve,\u201d Jonathan de Wet, chief investment officer at Zerocap, told DL News on Tuesday. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News that Tuesday\u2019s $381 million washout in Bitcoin and Ethereum derivative long positions was a net positive for market health. Analysts like de Wet and Lawant posit demand from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds is bolstering buying pressure, which far exceeds miners\u2019 ability to supply new coins to the market. On Wednesday, spot Bitcoin ETFs notched their biggest net inflows, at $648 million, since they began trading on January 11, according to data from Bitcoin ETF provider Bitwise. That\u2019s despite Bitcoin\u2019s volatility reaching its highest point in almost a year. In other words, issuers still seem willing to buy Bitcoin to meet demand from their clients, even as Bitcoin ETF purchases recorded a drop of more than 50% from March 5 to March 6. \u201cThese types of sharp corrections are a staple of crypto bull markets, and I see the leverage washout as healthy,\u201d Lawant told DL News on Thursday. To be sure, Acheson warned earlier in the week that more violent market swings are coming. \u201cFroth is still with us, which suggests that the volatility will continue,\u201d Acheson said. Traders have taken increasingly riskier bets on Bitcoin as it moved toward record highs over the past week, adding additional risk and volatility to the market. Deribit\u2019s implied volatility index, DVOL, which indicates the expected movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price, supports Acheson\u2019s outlook. The index broke the 71% threshold on Tuesday for the first time since the collapse of FTX. It remains elevated around 69%, suggesting prices will continue to whipsaw.

                "headline": "$84.5bn in derivative volumes push DeFi yields to highest levels in two years",
                "keypoints": "Following a record-setting week with $84.5 billion in volume, the decentralized derivatives sector saw continued momentum as GMX hit $1 billion in trading volume on March 4.\nGMX offers liquidity providers yields ranging from 11.8% to 105.3% APY across its versions.\nDeFi yields have reached a new peak, with the market-wide average yield hitting 5.4%.",
                "body": " According to DefiLlama\u2019s yield overview page, GMX or protocols that operate on top of GMX now offer four out of the top 10 highest yields for protocols that have at least $10 million in deposits. GMX is a decentralised perpetual trading exchange deployed on the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains. Perpetual futures, often referred to as perpetual swaps or simply \u201cperps,\u201d are a derivative contract that enables traders to bet on the future value of an asset indefinitely without an expiration date. Liquidity providers on GMX V1 are earning a 35.6% annual percentage yield and liquidity providers on GMX V2 are earning 11.8% to 105.3%. The source of these yields is driven by the increase in perpetual futures trading. The decentralised derivatives sector hit an all-time high weekly volume of $84.5 billion during the week ended March 1. For GMX, the increase in volumes continued in the first week of the month, as it generated over $1 billion in trading volume on March 4, the highest daily amount since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The weekly volume for decentralised derivative protocols (DefiLlama) Contrary to centralised exchanges, decentralised exchanges generally don\u2019t use market makers, or middlemen who match buy and sell orders. Instead, they rely on users to deposit assets in a liquidity pool that other users can then trade from. With GMX V1, liquidity providers deposit into GLP, an index made up of Ether, Bitcoin, LINK, UNI, and stablecoins. Once a user deposits an asset into GLP, they are exposed to the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. On the other hand, GMX V2 doesn\u2019t use one basket of assets, but rather uses isolated pools for each asset. This allows liquidity providers to pick exactly which assets they want exposure to while providing liquidity. GMX V1 and GMX V2 combined have over $593 million in deposits. The assets deposited in these pools earn a portion of the fees paid by traders. On GMX V1, traders pay a 0.1% fee on the total size of their trade, while on GMX V2, the fee is slightly lower at between 0.05% and 0.07% of the trade size. There are additional fees, as well, like funding fees, which have recently risen due to the increase in trader demand for leverage. But these yields come with risks, too. As with any protocol, there are always smart contract risks such as bugs in the computer code or exploits from nefarious actors. Although GMX has received audits for V1 and V2, audits do not catch all potential risks. Additionally, liquidity providers on GMX are the counterparty to traders. When traders close a profitable trade, the profits for that trade come out of the liquidity pools. Driven by increases in yields offered by protocols like GMX, the market-wide DeFi yield just hit its highest level since March 3, 2022. The seven-day average yield, calculated over all tracked pools on DefiLlama on a given day, hit 5.4% yesterday. This is a 3.7 percentage point increase from the bear market low of 1.67% on September 26. Historical annual percentage yield in DeFi (DefiLlama) With an overall resurgence in decentralised finance, as seen in the total value of crypto assets deposited in protocols and total volume generated by decentralised exchanges hitting their highest levels in years, the yield could continue to increase. Furthermore, some of the highest yields are generated by decentralised derivatives exchanges like GMX, and compared with their centralised counterparts, there is room to grow. According to data from Rabbitx, decentralised derivative exchanges did $12 billion in total volume in the last 24 hours, while centralised exchanges did over $458 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "How an obscure 4chan meme gave birth to a cryptocurrency that went up 1,800%",
                "keypoints": "A memecoin based on \"mogging\" is one of the crypto bull market's top performers.\nThe mogging meme has links to misogyny and toxic masculinity, an internet culture researcher says.\nMembers of the Mog Coin community say the meme has transcended its origin.",
                "body": " With the crypto bull market in full swing, memecoins \u2014 tokens without any function or use case that trade solely on their popularity and sentiment \u2014 are soaring. Among the list of top performers is Mog Coin, launched in March 2023. It\u2019s up an eye-watering 1,800% over the past month amid a $6.4 billion memecoin trading frenzy in February. Mog Coin now trades at a market value of over $371 million. Mog Coin is the latest example of a meme from the fringes of the internet gaining popularity in crypto. The term \u201cmog,\u201d a corruption of the acronym \u201calpha male of the group,\u201d can be traced to posts on online forum 4chan as far back as 2016. \u201cTo \u2018mog\u2019 someone is to assert one\u2019s dominance over them \u2014 usually men \u2014 hoping to impress women,\u201d Si\u00e2n Brooke, a researcher at the London School of Economics who studies online communities, told DL News. Brooke said the term, which comes from the intersection of bodybuilding and pickup artist communities, is linked to ideas of misogyny and toxic masculinity. \u201cWomen are not valued in these communities but are objectified and seen as a prize to obtain,\u201d she said. But members of the Mog Coin community say the meme has transcended its original meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s about rising above the ordinary, striving for greatness, and manifesting our deepest desires and highest potential,\u201d Alphapriest777, a pseudonymous investor in Mog Coin, told DL News. \u201cThe underlying message is the same: We\u2019re here to level up, to support each other, and to leave a lasting impact,\u201d Alphapriest said. And mogging isn\u2019t the first time lingo from 4chan has crossed over into crypto. WAGMI, an acronym for \u201cwe\u2019re all gonna make it,\u201d which became a rallying cry among crypto investors during the previous bull run, also traces its origin to posts on 4chan and bodybuilding.com. The phrase was popularised by bodybuilder Aziz \u201cZyzz\u201d Shavershian in 2010 before crossing over into crypto circles around 2017. Financial trading has historically been a male-dominated world. In crypto, where trading risks \u2014 and rewards \u2014 are amplified, the same macho attitudes are also commonplace. One reason for this, according to Brooke, is that by owning crypto, \u201cmen can reflect ideal forms of masculinity through evidence of a willingness to take risks, display esoteric knowledge, and demonstrate fortitude and independence.\u201d The Mog Coin website says the memecoin is about confidence, success, and \u201cbeing the best version of yourself in anything you do.\u201d Alphapriest attributed Mog Coin\u2019s success to its culture of \u201cwinning, resilience, and rising above the mediocre\u201d and its \u201ccelebration of the hustle, the grind, and the unwavering belief in our own potential.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a daily reminder of what\u2019s possible when a group of like-minded, passionate individuals come together and decide to aim higher,\u201d Alphapriest said. However, there is often a darker side to how masculinity manifests itself in such online communities. A cornerstone of the mogging meme is \u201clooksmaxing,\u201d an idea popular among young men who want to change their appearance to become more attractive and gain social acceptance. It has roots in \u201clookism,\u201d a prejudice or discrimination toward people who are considered to be physically unattractive that is popular in incel circles. Tropes such as \u201calphas,\u201d a term used to denote men who embody the sexual and sporting success of mainstream, desirable masculinity, and \u201cbetas,\u201d the opposite of alphas, are common. Brooke said the concept of alphas and betas is tied to a toxic framing of gender in which women are denied personhood. \u201cThey are seen as irrational, interchangeable, hardwired to pair with alpha males, and needing to be dominated,\u201d she said. To what extent these ideas are actively propagated in the Mog Coin community is unclear. \u201cMemes often get away with being bigoted or sexist by claiming to be ironic,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cOnline, it\u2019s hard to tell when someone genuinely expresses themselves or mocks them unless they make their intentions clear.\u201d \u201cOf course, mog is much bigger than any acronym,\u201d Wolf, a pseudonymous admin in the official Mog Coin Telegram group \u2014 a messaging app \u2014 told DL News. When asked about Mog Coin\u2019s alpha male of the group origin, Wolf listed several alternative acronyms for mog, such as men of God, maiden of God, monkeys, orangutans, gorillas, multiple orgasm giver, and magical opportunity generator. Like with many other popular internet subcultures, nods to right-wing politics are also present in mogging and Mog Coin. On the official Mog Coin X account, a pinned video of a breakdancing Donald Trump sporting a pair of pit vipers \u2014 the iridescent sunglasses that have become synonymous with the Mog Coin community \u2014 greets potential initiates. It is also up for debate to what extent the broader Mog Coin community supports such uses of right-wing figures. Pepe, a memecoin based on comics artist Matt Furie\u2019s enduring Pepe the Frog character, has also previously been linked to right-wing circles. But the meme has broader appeal. While extremist groups sometimes co-opt Pepe the Frog to make racist memes, the character is broadly used in crypto circles to emote the ups and downs of crypto trading. The meme also became popular as a symbol of resistance during the 2019 Hong Kong democracy protests. Last year, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal publicly apologised on X after the crypto exchange labelled Pepe as an alt-right \u201chate symbol.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Bitcoin briefly touched record highs on Tuesday before it plunged as much as 12% to flutter around $60,000. The rapid rise and fall kicked off a cascade of liquidations across the market, marking the second worst day for traders since the collapse of FTX. Liquidations totalled more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data as of noon London time on Wednesday. Traders with long positions on Bitcoin and Ethereum lost nearly $340 million. Tuesday\u2019s \u201cleverage washout,\u201d in Bitcoin and Ethereum long positions, was the second-highest daily loss since November 2022, when the FTX crypto exchange crashed, according to David Lawant, head of research at crypto trading platform FalconX. It comes on the back of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds having stolen the limelight since their approval in January. \u201cThe market became myopically focused on the Bitcoin ETF narrative, ignoring the excessive leverage and positioning in the derivatives market,\u201d Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at research firm Real Vision, said on X following Bitcoin\u2019s drop. Bitcoin derivatives markets had shown signs of overheating leading up to the collapse, with Coutts and other analysts warning of a potential spike in volatility on Monday. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalisation was trading above $66,000 again on Wednesday, but prices could fall again, analysts warn. \u201cWhen positioning was as extreme as it was leading into the selloff, there is likely to be a bit more downside before that leverage is flushed out,\u201d Coutts told DL News. \u201cThe last pullback in January took over a month before it broke above new all-time highs. I expect in the next one to two months, Bitcoin will be at new highs,\u201d he said. Bitcoin is expected to climb to $150,000 to $200,000 over the next year, depending on who you ask. Of the more than $1 billion in liquidations in the past day, over $810 million came from long positions being wiped out, CoinGlass data showed. Bitcoin accounted for around $218 million of long liquidations. Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange automatically closes a trader\u2019s position when there isn\u2019t enough money to cover the losses, or what is known as margin. Open interest on Bitcoin futures contracts on Binance fell dramatically following the crash. Binance\u2019s most popular Bitcoin market, BTC/USD, saw open interest, or the number of outstanding futures contracts, fall by 8.5% to $5 billion, in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

                "body": " Grayscale\u2019s gambit with high management fees is beginning to look like a shrewd piece of business as Bitcoin set a fresh record high against the dollar. Even as the digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, GBTC, has experienced an exodus of $9.2 billion since converting to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, its assets under management remain largely unchanged, clocking in at $28.4 billion as of Tuesday. \u201cWhile Grayscale is losing investors it has more assets than when it launched \u2014 a phenomenon we call the bull-market subsidy,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told DL News. The same phenomenon occurs in other traditional financial products, like active mutual funds, he said. Despite years of \u201cbloodbath outflows\u201d the funds have more \u201cassets and revenue than ever simply because the market went up,\u201d Balchunas said. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s at play with GBTC. Bitcoin has rallied over 50% since January and set a record high above $69,100 on Tuesday. Despite Grayscale\u2019s challenges, the Bitcoin rally has enabled it to keep the value of GBTC\u2019s assets at an even keel. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s recent price surge has essentially offset the fund\u2019s massive outflows,\u201d Nate Geraci, president of financial advisory firm The ETFStore, told DL News. Since ETF fees are calculated and accrued daily Grayscale \u201chasn\u2019t lost any fee revenue if we assume a steady state in assets and the price of bitcoin moving forward,\u201d Geraci said. The firm\u2019s fee approach will likely continue \u201cruffling some feathers,\u201d but it looks like a \u201csavvy business move at this early juncture,\u201d Geraci said. It\u2019s possible Grayscale predicted spot Bitcoin ETF approval would \u201ccreate a new wave of demand,\u201d and push up the price of Bitcoin, Geraci said, \u201cif so, that looks smart right now.\u201d Based on GBTC\u2019s current assets under management of $28.4 billion, Grayscale\u2019s implied annual revenue is $420 million. Still, Grayscale faces pressure from all sides. Nine others ETFs, including ones run by Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, also launched on January 11. Rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s fees are 125 basis points lower than Grayscale at 0.25%. The Wall Street firms\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $11.5 billion and $7.5 billion in assets under management, respectively. That means both firms would make just under $30 million each from fee revenue in 2024, if on current assets and fees, not including fee promotions. Despite GBTC\u2019s market share falling to 55% from 100%, it\u2019s still leading on revenue. Grayscale did not return a request for comment from DL News.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin nears an all-time high anticipated by market watchers.\nExperts say this is thanks to regulators approving Bitcoin ETFs early this year.",
                "body": " The crypto industry is euphoric as Bitcoin\u2019s bull run has brought its price back to highs last reached in November 2021. And it\u2019s all thanks to Gary Gensler, experts say. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission chair gave the nod to 11 highly anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, the price of Bitcoin has been soaring. \u201cGensler should be really proud. This is a big achievement,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News. Balchunas said the ETFs have provided a safe and easy way for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. \u201cETFs rock! They\u2019re really good at what they do, especially compared to what was out there before them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy access, cheap, liquid, tax efficient. And they have a lot of safeguards in place; they\u2019re regulated and they have legal documents and risk disclosures attached to them.\u201d No wonder investors are piling in. Bitcoin has soared along with daily trading volume for BlackRock\u2019s new iShares Bitcoin Trust, which has smashed records and has crossed $10 billion in flows. It\u2019s nonetheless ironic that the industry has Gensler to thank for the ETFs, and therefore the rally, which has seen Bitcoin jump almost 40% this year and temporarily crossed $63,000 this week. The hard-charging chair\u2019s tenure has been marked by a crackdown on crypto businesses, with Gensler asserting repeatedly that the industry is rife with fraud and non-compliance. He made it clear in approving the ETFs that he was doing so only because told to by the courts. Gensler should have taken a victory lap after approving the ETFs, Balchunas said. \u201dETFs are a way to limit the audience that fraudsters and hucksters get.\u201d They\u2019re a win for consumer protection, which is after all the SEC\u2019s mandate. \u201cWe always thought the SEC was blind to the fact that the ETFs would help it achieve this goal,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that putting these ETFs out there and having by-the-book, legit companies running them with tons of compliance is a good way to limit the amount of damage that fraudsters and hucksters can do.\u201d It\u2019s likely that Gensler thought approving ETFs would legitimise Bitcoin and crypto more generally. \u2018It\u2019s not like they put heroin in an ETF.\u2019 The chair said SEC approval of the ETFs does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin itself, and that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d However, Balchunas noted, the SEC had already legitimised crypto. After all, investors could buy from Coinbase \u2014 a listed company \u2014 and the SEC had already approved Bitcoin futures products. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they put heroin in an ETF. You can get Bitcoin at exchanges that are publicly traded,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was already pretty legitimised, ETFs are just a better way to do it.\u201d Rebecca Rettig, chief legal and policy officer at Polygon Labs, told DL News that the current bull run is a result of a new image for Bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that there\u2019s acknowledgement that not just Bitcoin, but the industry is being taken more and more seriously,\u201d Rettig said. And, traditional financial markets are talking about Bitcoin\u2019s flight, thanks to ETFs, she said. Still, she said \u201ccrypto markets are evolving and nuanced, and so nothing is ever attributable to one thing alone.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s halving coming up in April is another potential price driver. The halving is programmed to occur once every four years to reduce the amount of new Bitcoin that can be created by miners. After the last halving, in 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared more than 600%. Have a tip? Reach out at joanna@dlnews.com and inbar@dlnews.com"

                "headline": "Four ways BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL tokenised fund on Ethereum will revolutionise markets",
                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly sucessful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "headline": "CME exec on why Bitcoin and Ethereum are \u2018too large, too big\u2019 for Wall Street to ignore",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "headline": "Ex-Citadel dev turned crypto exchange founder has a plan to prevent the next FTX",
                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been attributed as a key driver behind the digital asset\u2019s recovery this year, but the head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX says that relationship is about to change. \u201cIf until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\u201d David Lawant posted on Thursday. The market is now entering a phase where Lawant expects to see more reflexivity, he added. Reflexivity refers to a feedback loop where market trends and the fundamentals influencing them can enhance each other. In this case, it would translate to the Bitcoin price soaring, which would then drive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would drive the price higher.

However, a more dramatic price hike may take a while, Lawant said. \u201cIf the past cycle is any guide, we might hover around the current levels for a while before decisively breaking into a new inning of the bull market trend,\u201d Lawant said. \u201cAll market signals so far indicate that the current bull market trend remains in place.\u201d On Tuesday, US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the spot market saw their largest daily net inflows since they began trading on January 11 at $648 million, according to Bitwise.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly sucessful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun. (Metrika) VOTE: Aave to add GMX\u2019s gmETH to its Arbitrum liquidity pool VOTE: Jupiter DAO concludes vote on LFG launchpad candidates VOTE: Arbitrum votes on new $4 million grants programme Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin slaps back at an X user complaining about high transaction fees. Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin hit another new all-time high just above $71,000 on Monday.\nThis is the fourth time the cryptocurrency has broken its own record in a week.\nBreaking the $71,000 barrier comes as the Bitcoin price is starting to fuel ETF inflows, marking a change in investor behaviour.",
                "body": " Bitcoin surged past $71,000 on Monday morning, London time, breaking its own record for the fourth time in a week. The new record comes as the cryptocurrency is starting to drive inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to an analyst \u2014 not the other way around. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been attributed as a key driver behind the digital asset\u2019s recovery this year, but the head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX says that relationship is about to change. \u201cIf until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\u201d David Lawant posted on Thursday. The market is now entering a phase where Lawant expects to see more reflexivity, he added. Reflexivity refers to a feedback loop where market trends and the fundamentals influencing them can enhance each other. In this case, it would translate to the Bitcoin price soaring, which would then drive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would drive the price higher. Bitcoin broke its November 2021 all-time high three times over the past week: on Tuesday, Friday, and over the weekend, breaking the $69,100, $69,200, and $70,000 barrier, respectively. However, a more dramatic price hike may take a while, Lawant said. \u201cIf the past cycle is any guide, we might hover around the current levels for a while before decisively breaking into a new inning of the bull market trend,\u201d Lawant said. \u201cAll market signals so far indicate that the current bull market trend remains in place.\u201d On Tuesday, US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the spot market saw their largest daily net inflows since they began trading on January 11 at $648 million, according to Bitwise.

                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours.

                "body": " Bitcoin surged past $71,000 on Monday morning, London time, breaking its own record for the fourth time in a week. The new record comes as the cryptocurrency is starting to drive inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to an analyst \u2014 not the other way around. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been attributed as a key driver behind the digital asset\u2019s recovery this year, but the head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX says that relationship is about to change. \u201cIf until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\u201d David Lawant posted on Thursday. The market is now entering a phase where Lawant expects to see more reflexivity, he added. Reflexivity refers to a feedback loop where market trends and the fundamentals influencing them can enhance each other. In this case, it would translate to the Bitcoin price soaring, which would then drive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would drive the price higher. Bitcoin broke its November 2021 all-time high three times over the past week: on Tuesday, Friday, and over the weekend, breaking the $69,100, $69,200, and $70,000 barrier, respectively. However, a more dramatic price hike may take a while, Lawant said. \u201cIf the past cycle is any guide, we might hover around the current levels for a while before decisively breaking into a new inning of the bull market trend,\u201d Lawant said. \u201cAll market signals so far indicate that the current bull market trend remains in place.\u201d On Tuesday, US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the spot market saw their largest daily net inflows since they began trading on January 11 at $648 million, according to Bitwise.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Sam Bankman-Fried shows little remorse as he is sentenced to 25 years for $11bn FTX crypto fraud",
                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "headline": "DeFi exchange dYdX attracts stakers amid $41bn in trading volume",
                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders. Correction: This story was updated on March 13 to correct an inaccurate trading volume figure provided by dYdX. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun. (Metrika) VOTE: Aave to add GMX\u2019s gmETH to its Arbitrum liquidity pool VOTE: Jupiter DAO concludes vote on LFG launchpad candidates VOTE: Arbitrum votes on new $4 million grants programme Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin slaps back at an X user complaining about high transaction fees. Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments.

These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Sam Bankman-Fried shows little remorse as he is sentenced to 25 years for $11bn FTX crypto fraud",
                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "More than 50% of Solana transactions failed last month. Here\u2019s why",
                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "headline": "ZkLink looks to solve Ethereum\u2019s fragmented liquidity with a layer 3 \u2014 but there are risks",
                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "headline": "Welcome to Anon Island, where 800 users are set to compete onchain for $250,000",
                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "Base's user metrics soared following the Dencun upgrade, achieving record low transaction costs and an all-time high of 855,000 daily active users.\nThe upgrade slashed Base transaction fees by 99.9% from the fees on Ethereum.\nThe upcoming Coinbase smart wallet may further boost Base's growth by making it easier for users to gain access to decentralised apps and assets.",
                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Sam Bankman-Fried shows little remorse as he is sentenced to 25 years for $11bn FTX crypto fraud",
                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "headline": "Welcome to Anon Island, where 800 users are set to compete onchain for $250,000",
                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "body": " On Monday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust recorded its highest daily outflow since it first began to trade as a spot exchange-traded fund in January. The latest outflows come as Bitcoin fell over $10,000 from its fresh all-time high, set last week. GBTC witnessed $643 million worth of Bitcoin exit the ETF, $3 million more than its second-largest outflow recorded on January 22, BitMex Research data shows. The digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has witnessed a $3.1 billion exodus in the last two weeks. The massive outflows from Grayscale\u2019s fund have been attributed, in part, to its high fee structure. Investors in Grayscale\u2019s flagship product pay a 1.5% management fee, which is far higher than any of its revival issuers. Other issuers, such as WisdomTree, have waived fees for the first six months or up to $1 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan warned outflows were putting pressure on Grayscale to lower its fees in January, but the issuer has shown no intention of doing so. Last week Grayscale filed for a new spot Bitcoin ETF which would have a lower fee. Grayscale\u2019s decision to launch the second ETF is likely in response to the \u201cexodus,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, and roughly 12.5% over the last seven days to around $63,200. Even with Grayscale facing difficulties, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has helped maintain GBTC\u2019s asset value at a relatively stable level, DL News previously reported. As the price of Bitcoin begins to fall, issuers may continue to see a further decrease in total assets under management. Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.

                "body": " User metrics on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network that was incubated by centralised crypto exchange Coinbase, have surged since Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 13, lowering transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Dencun was a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced \u201cblobs,\u201d which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Thanks to Dencun, the median transaction cost on Base hit the lowest level of any layer 2 network. The cost to swap on popular decentralised exchange Uniswap now costs only $0.0018, and the cost to transfer Ether between wallets is only $0.004. Median gas price to perform different transaction types on top layer 2 blockchains (GasFees.io) A swap on Base is now 99.9% cheaper than it is on Ethereum, and it\u2019s 98% cheaper than it is on Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 network by total value locked, User metrics on Base surged following the upgrade, most notably, on March 16, when the number of daily active users hit an all-time high of more than 855,000. Daily active users on Base (Dune: Watermeloncrypto) The number of transactions in a single day hit an all-time high of more than 2.1 million on March 16, and as of today, there is $709 million of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain, another all-time high. This makes Base the 11th-largest blockchain in terms of total value of crypto assets deposited and the fourth-largest Ethereum rollup. Aerodrome, a decentralised exchange, is the top protocol on Base by total value of crypto assets deposited, with over $310 million deposited and $482 million in weekly volume, both all-time highs. The native token, AERO, is up 19% in the last seven days. Still, some users think that Base has even more room to grow because of the release of the Coinbase smart wallet. Jesse Pollack, founder of Base, introduced the wallet to social media on March 1, saying it is the last piece to bringing billions of people onchain. The wallet is still in a testing phase, but once it is live, it will enable traders on Coinbase to use their Coinbase balance to trade onchain. That would significantly enhance the user experience for Coinbase users, because they would be able to access decentralised apps, tokens, and NFTs that aren\u2019t available on the centralised exchange without having to use different wallet apps. For protocols, once the wallet is released, it potentially opens the door to an influx of new users who may have not conducted transactions onchain before. Given the close ties between Base and Coinbase, some believe Base will be the biggest beneficiary of this new change. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Bitcoin had a rough weekend. It has fallen from March 14\u2032s all-time high above $73,500 to about $66,900, as US inflation data in the past few days have knocked its price. Bitcoin dropped to an 11-day low of $64,450 on Sunday. \u201cDrops like this serve as a reminder that BTC will never totally decouple from macro drivers,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, wrote on Saturday. The inflation measure known as the US Producer Price Index rose a higher-than-expected 1.6% in February compared to 12 months ago, with a surprise 0.6% gain since January. However, the ongoing dilution of fiat currency is expected to reclaim its central role in investment discussions once market volatility subsides, Acheson said. Others agree that fundamentals in traditional markets are at play. \u201cAlthough the changing macro environment deserves close attention, this is looking just like a typical crypto bull market correction,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX, wrote in a newsletter on Friday. A correction is a 10% drop in an asset; Bitcoin\u2019s fall from its high earlier this month to its Sunday marks a decline of about 12%. The analyst pointed to two factors that will continue to drive speculation over the coming months: releases detailing fund management firms\u2019 holdings of Bitcoin, as well as possible listings of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million must submit their quarterly 13F forms detailing their security holdings by May 15. That should give investors a glimpse into whether institutional investors are really buying up the asset, and could bring about surprises, Lawant said. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month delayed until late April its decision on whether to greenlight the trading of options on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a filing from Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The potential listing of options on Bitcoin spot ETFs \u201ccould bring in a new wave of inflows,\u201d Lawant said. Options are derivatives that are often used to hedge against losses or wager on the underlying asset\u2019s future price. A slow in total inflows comes amid outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust, which average at around $262 million daily, data shows. The average for total inflows, as of February 26, stands at $270 million. The outlook for spot Bitcoin inflows \u201cremains bright,\u201d as large institutions are still in the early stages of opening access for their clients, Lawant said.

                "body": " Bitcoin has rallied 73% this year, driven by record inflows into new spot exchange-traded funds. Investors now look towards the upcoming halving, an event designed to shrink the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and, in theory, drive up the price. Each of the three prior halvings since Bitcoin\u2019s creation has seen large \u2014 but volatile \u2014 price rallies. But this time, Bitcoin ETFs have changed the market dynamics, said Coinbase analysts in a Tuesday report. They said Bitcoin will rise \u201cin a gradual, sustained manner\u201d \u2014 marking a shift from its boom-and-bust past. Miners currently create about 900 new Bitcoin per day, worth about $65 million using today\u2019s price. The halving, estimated to occur on April 20, will cut distribution in half, which Coinbase said sets the stage for \u201cmarket tightness\u201d in the near term. Another source of tight conditions is ETF inflows, which have outpaced the new Bitcoin supply generated by miners. Net flows hit over $1 billion on Tuesday, according to an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Coinbase analysts say ETFs gobbling up Bitcoin flows will make this time different. The analysts said liquidity presented the \u201cmain setback\u201d to rising prices after previous halvings. When large market participants exited long positions around former halvings, they drove sell-offs that crashed Bitcoin\u2019s price. But this cycle, the jump in market liquidity brought by ETFs has a chance of smoothing things out, Coinbase said. The ETFs generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in daily spot-trading volumes, which makes \u201cliquidity sufficiently large for institutions to trade\u201d without causing price crashes. Bitcoin ETFs are \u201creshaping Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics by establishing a new anchor for BTC demand,\u201d according to Coinbase. Coinbase said the constant demand from ETFs \u201ccould be positive for Bitcoin\u2019s price over the long-run by creating a more balanced market with less volatility from concentrated selling.\u201d While prior halvings ushered highly volatile Bitcoin rallies, Coinbase urged caution when making comparisons, noting that the past three halvings weren\u2019t enough of a sample to make accurate predictions. Bitcoin\u2019s performance in earlier halvings was \u201cmost likely context dependent,\u201d Coinbase said, citing macroeconomic events such as Brexit in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as catalysts.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
                "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

                "headline": "Uniswap Labs generates daily fee record with higher charge \u2014 but will the increase prompt users to go elsewhere?",
                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "headline": "Renzo leans into layer 2s to boost market share, with more integrations on the way",
                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins threaten to privatise key roles that central banks play in the financial system.\nA new project from a group of central banks aims to fight back.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "headline": "Ex-Citadel dev turned crypto exchange founder has a plan to prevent the next FTX",
                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "More than 50% of Solana transactions failed last month. Here\u2019s why",
                "keypoints": "Solana transactions have failed 70% of the time, at least since mid-March.\nMost of the failed transactions are from trading bots.\nTransactions from real users often fail due to slippage.",
                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "headline": "Uniswap Labs generates daily fee record with higher charge \u2014 but will the increase prompt users to go elsewhere?",
                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1.

While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " Update, March 22: A previous headline for this story, \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, says executive,\u201d has been changed due to misattribution of sentiment. Solana, the industry\u2019s go-to blockchain for memecoin speculation of late, has seen 70% of its transactions fail this past month. That\u2019s according to data from this Dune dashboard, which shows that, on average, most non-voting Solana transactions failed since February 22. Non-voting transactions are user transactions that usually involve sending Solana tokens across accounts or smart contracts. They differ from voting transactions, which are by validators \u2014 network participants who stake Solana to secure the blockchain and process transactions in exchange for a share of the fees. \u201cThe failed transactions are mostly always bots,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius Labs, told DL News. Traders use bots to automate their trading strategies. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience.\u201d In fact, for organic users \u2014 those who aren\u2019t automating their trades \u2014 failed transactions can be attributed to one culprit, slippage, Mumtaz explained. Slippage occurs when the value of a trade changes between its execution and when a trader receives their tokens. This can be a costly expense, especially when trading low-liquidity memecoins. Traders often have to raise slippage limits to accommodate price swings that occur while their trading orders are finalised on the blockchain. Transaction failure can happen in instances where the price swing exceeds the slippage limit. Mumtaz argued that Solana\u2019s fail rate issue was being misrepresented as a problem. \u201cA failed transaction means that the network processed the transaction successfully \u2014 it paid fees, made state changes, and went through the same pipelines \u2014 but the app developer specifically made it \u2018revert\u2019 on purpose,\u201d Mumtaz said. \u201cThis has always been how Solana has worked since day one, so there\u2019s no difference in user experience,\u201d Mumtaz said, adding that the solution to the issue was \u201cpretty simple.\u201d \u201cYou just want to make it so that spamming the chain isn\u2019t as viable economically and also you want to incentivise block packers to include more successful transactions so they can maximise their revenue.\u201d Indeed, the high fail rate doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened enthusiasm among traders, with Solana experiencing greater user volume than Ethereum. This expanding user activity comes as 20,000 tokens are being launched on the blockchain daily, according to Solana explorer SolanaFM. Crypto bridge protocol deBridge crossed $1 billion in user volume on Friday, and over half of that figure was traded through Solana. The platform noted that about a third of that sum has been bridged from other networks to Solana. While the transaction might not be a problem for the everyday user, Solana still experiences repeated outages and degraded performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum layer 2 networks, seen as rivals to Solana for their low network fees, have become even cheaper to use since Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade.

                "headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs will test Chinese restrictions on crypto investing with billions at stake",
                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "headline": "Uniswap Labs generates daily fee record with higher charge \u2014 but will the increase prompt users to go elsewhere?",
                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "headline": "Renzo leans into layer 2s to boost market share, with more integrations on the way",
                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins threaten to privatise key roles that central banks play in the financial system.\nA new project from a group of central banks aims to fight back.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison for defrauding crypto investors.\nThe onetime crypto wunderkind struck a defiant tone at the sentencing hearing.\nBankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction.",
                "body": " A federal judge for the Southern District of New York sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison Thursday, citing the former FTX CEO\u2019s \u201capparent lack of remorse,\u201d \u201cexceptional flexibility with the truth,\u201d and the \u201cbrazenness\u201d of his fraud. The term was about half the 40 to 50 years prosecutors sought. US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan\u2019s sentence came down five months after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the failure of FTX in November 2022. Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said he would appeal the jury\u2019s verdict. He has 14 days to file an appeal. Even though defendants usually express remorse to mitigate harsh sentences, Bankman-Fried, clad in beige prison garb and shackled at the ankles, occasionally struck a defiant tone as he stood and addressed the bench at Thursday\u2019s hearing. Echoing his failed defence last November, he blamed FTX\u2019s collapse on his \u201cmismanagement\u201d and a \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d rather than on outright fraud. \u201c[FTX customers] could have been paid back\u201d had he held onto the company, Bankman-Fried said during his meandering plea for leniency. \u201cThere were enough assets. There are enough assets. ... It\u2019s not because of a rise in the price of crypto.\u201d \u2018A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on on his sentence.\u2019 Kaplan didn\u2019t find the argument convincing. \u201cA thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on his sentence,\u201d Kaplan said at the beginning of the hearing. Kaplan went on to deliver a blistering appraisal of Bankman-Fried\u2019s character. Citing testimony about Bankman-Fried\u2019s propensity for risk taking, the judge decried the 32-year-old\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers and $3 billion from the exchange\u2019s lenders and investors. \u201cHe knew it was wrong, he knew it was criminal, [but] he regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood that he gets caught,\u201d Kaplan said. Describing Bankman-Fried as a \u201cvery high-achieving autistic person,\u201d Kaplan said it was clear the former billionaire \u201cwanted to be a hugely, hugely influential political person in this country.\u201d The judge also honed in on Bankman-Fried\u2019s disastrous performance on the stand. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance quite like that.\u201d Prosecutor Nicolas Roos argued a lengthy sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from committing more crimes. He cited an earlier comment from Mukasey, who said his client\u2019s decisions weren\u2019t motivated by malice, but by mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling,\u201d Roos said, \u201cbecause what it says is if Mr. Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he\u2019d do it again.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201csubstantially greater than necessary\u201d to deter Bankman-Fried from committing similar crimes in the future and to dissuade others from doing the same. In addition to the 25 year prison sentence, Kaplan levied an $11 billion fine on Bankman-Fried. Kaplan recommended Bankman-Fried spend his sentence in a medium- or low-security prison as close as possible to his Northern California home. In a maximum security prison intended for violent criminals, Bankman-Fried, autistic and associated with great wealth, could become a target of other inmates, the judge said. The sentence was more than four times longer than the term Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys requested ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing. DL News illustration by Darren Joseph In January, FTX\u2019s new leadership said it expects to fully reimburse customers at the value of their holdings at the time FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. \u201cThe most reasonable estimate of loss is zero,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote. Moreover, FTX never lost customer money in the first place \u2014 it simply had a shortfall of \u201cliquid assets.\u201d Had Bankman-Fried had more time to sell the company\u2019s assets, it would have been able to honor all customer withdrawals, his attorneys argued. This was a critical argument for the defense, as the duration of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence hinged, in large part, on federal guidelines that recommend certain prison sentences based on the amount of money stolen. But it didn\u2019t wash. Since the collapse of FTX, the market capitalisation of all crypto tokens has increased almost threefold, from just over $1 trillion to $2.6 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Now, customers who had entrusted their crypto to FTX want to be repaid in crypto \u2014 not in dollars that represent the value of their crypto at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One such customer, Sunil Kavuri, spoke at the sentencing. He said he had flown from London to speak on behalf of other jilted FTX customers, and called Bankman-Fried\u2019s assertion they would be made whole a \u201ccontinuous lie.\u201d Another speaker, Florida-based attorney Adam Moskowitz, asked the judge for leniency, citing Bankman-Fried\u2019s helpfulness in a class-action lawsuit he had filed against superstar NFL quarterback Tom Brady and other celebrity endorsers of FTX. At one time, FTX had been world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange after Binance. Attracting top-shelf venture-capitalist backers such as Sequoia Capital, FTX sported a valuation of $32 billion in early 2022. And Bankman-Fried courted celebrity supporters such as Brady and plastered the FTX brand on sports arenas and bought splashy Super Bowl TV commercials. The crypto wunderkind also bridged the gap with Wall Street by establishing strong ties to luminaries such as hedge fund manager and conference impresario Anthony Scaramucci. And he contributed millions to members of Congress and political action committees to curry influence on Capitol Hill. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his parents were prestigious law professors at Stanford University. In Bankman-Fried, finance and the political establishment finally found a face for the freewheeling crypto industry. With his slob-chic vibe of wrinkled T-shirts and cargo shorts, Bankman-Fried cast himself as the latest boy genius to spin billions of dollars in wealth from arcane techno-finance models. Yet prosecutors, led by Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, produced a powerful and persuasive narrative that depicted Bankman-Fried as a fraudster who deployed some of the oldest tricks in the book to fleece investors. He comingled deposits, moved funds around arbitrarily, and did not comply with many US regulations because his companies were domiciled in Hong Kong and then the Bahamas. Several former colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, testified that Bankman-Fried funnelled billions of dollars in deposits at FTX into his crypto investment fund, Alameda Research, to cover losses in 2022. They also told the jury that Bankman-Fried was not the head-in-the-clouds brainiac who knew little of the daily operations of his enterprises. In contrast, he was a hands on manager who designed and used backdoors to cook the books at both FTX and Alameda. The onetime crypto chieftain flopped when he took the stand himself. He frequently couldn\u2019t recall details of his tenure at FTX and Alameda. Among courtroom attendees, his \u201ccannot recall\u2019 riposte to prosecutors became a meme. It took the jury just a few hours to convict Bankman-Fried of his crimes. Now he will pay back his debt to society for the next 25 years.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin ETFs are forcing Wall Street institutions to educate their clients about cryptocurrencies.\nThe CME overtook Binance as the leading Bitcoin derivatives platform in November.\nIt now has over 50% more open interest than Binance.",
                "body": " Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds changed the game for crypto. Not only did the ETFs establish credibility and legitimise the crypto industry in Wall Street\u2019s eyes, they suddenly forced \u201csome very large distribution networks and very large marketing firms\u201d to promote Bitcoin to their clients, Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group\u2019s head of crypto, told DL News. The role of investment advisors is now to \u201chelp to educate their client base and help them understand why Bitcoin matters,\u201d said Vicioso. CME Group is the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges. \u201cAnd they have a very familiar product name \u2014 the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as a way to access,\u201d Vicioso added. Bitcoin spot ETFs, launched in January, enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of touching the crypto itself. The familiarity \u2014 ETFs have existed in the US since 1993 \u2014 means investing in the volatile cryptocurrency is less scary. Past conversations with clients about Bitcoin used to revolve around basics, Vicioso said. What is Bitcoin? Why should you be thinking about cryptocurrencies? Are coins being used for illicit purposes? But things have shifted since the ETFs launched. \u201cConversations nowadays are more and more around use cases: Why does Bitcoin make sense?\u201d Vicioso said. And discussions aren\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is also regularly brought up, and along with things that the smart contract technology entails \u2014 like tokenisation, DeFi, and web3. Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care just really too large, too big to ignore,\u201d Vicioso said. Last year, when speculation about Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval was at its height, some wondered whether the investment products would end syphoning some of the CME\u2019s trading activity. The opposite happened. Although open interest \u2014 a metric that reflects the total number of futures contracts outstanding \u2014 for Bitcoin futures wound down for a short period after the ETFs launched, it\u2019s now soaring to records. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities.\u201d Whereas CME had $6.3 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest on January 11, it now holds a little over $11.4 billion \u2014 roughly 50% more than its closest competitor, Binance. The exchange has now had six consecutive months of average daily open interest records. \u201cMore participants in the space are using our products to hedge some of the exposures to these ETFs,\u201d said Vicioso. And it isn\u2019t just Bitcoin. CME\u2019s Ether products have also registered record open interest \u2014 March registered a 14% increase in Ether open interest compared with February, and the average daily open interest has been breaking records for five months in a row. Some of that enthusiasm is channeled through the platform\u2019s micro contracts, dubbed micros, which are seeing \u201cfairly explosive growth,\u201d according to Vicioso. \u201cAs a liquidity provider, you sort of have to wait for a position in the ETFs to build in order to use a large contract to hedge some of those trades,\u201d Vicioso said. However, adding up micro contracts allows these market participants to operate with more flexibility. Regular Bitcoin futures are worth five Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $350,000. But micro contracts are worth a fraction of that: 0.1 Bitcoin, worth about $7,000. The same goes for Ether micros. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether micro contracts in March is at around $300 million, double that of February, while average trading daily volume in Bitcoin micro contracts alone is triple February\u2019s at over $414 million. Vicioso said demand for CME products comes from a diverse mix: hedge funds, banks, both crypto-native and ETF liquidity providers, as well as Bitcoin ETF issuers and authorised participants. But not everyone is using the platform\u2019s futures to hedge their positions. The ETFs made it easy for market participants to implement one of Wall Street\u2019s favourite market-neutral trading strategies: the basis trade. By buying Bitcoin ETF shares and shorting futures contracts on the CME, traders can profit from the discrepancies between spot price and the price of futures contracts. While the strategy has its risks, it enables traders to bag Bitcoin returns without making directional bets on the price. As the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs whether to approve a clutch of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, Vicioso said his firm\u2019s data holds clues as to how traders see the market evolving. He pointed to CME\u2019s reference rates and real-time indexes for 20 other cryptocurrencies \u2014 which include prices for projects such as Uniswap, Polygon, Cosmos, and Solana. Selected by the CME because of their potential use cases, these coins could be good candidates for eventual ETFs down the line. \u201cIn terms of additional futures contracts, or even additional ETFs on some of these coins, it\u2019s really a function of more regulatory clarity \u2014 whether these cryptocurrencies are considered commodities or securities,\u201d Vicioso said. Meanwhile, the CME wants to enhance its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. \u201cThe entry point into the market would be Bitcoin, followed by Ether,\u201d Vicioso said. The company has been improving access to its existing products by adding clearing firms and brokers. \u201cAccess had been a concern for some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made some inroads there and our markets are now more accessible to a wider swath of clients.\u201d One product the exchange recently launched was micro euro Bitcoin and Ether futures \u2014 which work the same as the original micro futures contracts, except they are dominated in euros, not US dollars. The new product should make it more efficient for market participants based in Europe to hedge their activity in euro-denominated investment vehicles. \u201cThe European market is well positioned for growth,\u201d Vicioso said, thanks to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulatory framework passed by the European Union in 2023. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work lockstep with clients, to better understand and anticipate their needs, which really is the driving force behind everything that we do,\u201d he added.

                "headline": "Ex-Citadel dev turned crypto exchange founder has a plan to prevent the next FTX",
                "keypoints": "Cube.Exchange is a centralised exchange that provides non-custodial wallet services.\nThe exchange is launching a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that acts as a third party that checks that Cube isn\u2019t misusing customer funds.",
                "body": " As disgraced crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried braces for sentencing this week, the industry is amping up efforts to prevent the kind of fraud that led to FTX\u2019s downfall. One of these initiatives comes from Cube.Exchange, a trading platform launched in December by co-founder and CEO Bartosz Lipi\u0144ski. Cube is technically a centralised exchange, like Coinbase or Binance, but its infrastructure mirrors decentralised exchanges like GMX in a crucial way: The Cube team does not have unilateral control over customer deposits. \u201cFrom a custody perspective, our solution is unique, because we\u2019re building a decentralised Fireblocks,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski told DL News. He is referring to the platform that helps institutions like BNY Mellon hold cryptocurrencies securely. \u201cBut we are offering it at zero cost,\u201d he added. Lipinski jumped to crypto in January 2021, joining Solana as a software engineer, after years in the finance industry. He worked as head of equities application development at Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel, and before that, was lead developer at JPMorgan. Customers can deposit funds on the exchange and use the platform with the same ease as with any centralised exchange. But trades are settled on-chain, which means users can track in real time where their funds are. Other exchanges, like Coinbase, lump these funds together in cold storage. Cube is now launching what it calls a \u201cGuardian Council\u201d that will act as a third-party validator group to prevent the platform from misappropriating customer funds. These guardians are involved in the transaction authorisation process, meaning that Cube isn\u2019t capable of manipulating user funds. And in event of an exchange failure, the guardians are able to facilitate withdrawals. In other words, Cube\u2019s infrastructure should make it impossible for users to suffer the same ordeal as when FTX collapsed. Initial guardians include the Solana Foundation and crypto staking service providers Everstake, Kiln, and Juicy Stake. Triton One, a specialised crypto infrastructure server provider, constitutes the fifth member of the council. Lipi\u0144ski says he expects the list to grow. While the exchange isn\u2019t listed yet on crypto price aggregation sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, Lipi\u0144ski told DL News that it processes $1 million in daily trading volume. And he expects more interest as Wall Street wades deeper into the crypto space. \u201cOver the long run, there will be more people that directly integrate with the blockchain itself,\u201d said Lipi\u0144ski. And they\u2019ll want cheaper custody offerings. \u201cThose custody providers will ultimately drive the costs of the Bitcoin spot ETFs in the long run,\u201d Lipi\u0144ski said, adding that some market participants have already reached out to use Cube\u2019s technology. Another of Cube\u2019s advantages lies in its focus on speed and performance. The exchange is capable of filling trading orders within 0.2 milliseconds \u2014 about 10 times faster than Coinbase and 25 times faster than Binance. Cube raised $12 million in a Series A funding round in February, three months after raising $9 million for a seed round. The company is valued at $100 million, according to The Block.

                "body": " One group of wallets on Base, the Ethereum layer 2 network incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase, has turned $1,824 into over $2.1 million amid the memecoin trading frenzy. The holders, however, can\u2019t cash in all of their chips at once because of the small size of the coin\u2019s liquidity pool. The story starts with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, an upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that went live on March 13 and that caused transaction fees on layer 2 blockchains to drop by as much as 98%. With the lower fees, traders rushed to Base, as the platform had an all-time high of 855,191 active users on March 16. The total daily volume generated on Base hit an all-time high of $394 million on March 19, with a majority of the volume coming from memecoin traders, who tend to be price sensitive and who therefore were drawn in by the drastically lower transaction fees One memecoin in particular, NORMIE, which is branded toward \u201cnormies,\u201d or individuals entering crypto for the first time, rose 71,089% from its launch on March 6 to its peak on March 16. On the day of its launch, wallet address 0xb3, received 0.299 Ether from a centralised exchange. That wallet went on to send 0.1 Ether to wallet addresses, 0x6b and 0x57. All three of these wallets then purchased NORMIE on March 6 while the price per NORMIE was around $0.00007. Collectively, the three wallets purchased 24.4 million NORMIE, or 2.4% of the total supply, across 11 transactions. A fourth wallet, 0x45, which was also funded from a centralised exchange on March 6, is connected to wallet 0x6b because they sent 0.01 Ether to them on March 9. The wallet had similar transaction history, purchasing 5.5 million NORMIE with three transactions from March 6 to March 9. It is unknown whether this cluster of wallets is one individual or an entity. So far, these wallets have sold a total of 2.4 million NORMIE, or around $59,000. They still hold about 22 million NORMIE, or $2.1 million. The group, or individual, controlling these wallets cannot offload their entire NORMIE holdings in one go because the liquidity pools for the token have only about $2.2 million. A sudden, large-scale sale would likely crash NORMIE\u2019s market price. Consequently, it appears the holders are adopting a strategy of gradually selling their tokens to avoid drastically affecting the token\u2019s value. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin halving just happened \u2014 here\u2019s what it means",
                "keypoints": "The Bitcoin halving happened in the first hours of Saturday, London time.\nThe impact is huge for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nBut what it means for Bitcoin\u2019s price is more nuanced.",
                "body": " It finally happened. The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry, occurred in the first hours of Saturday, London time. From now on, the network will create half as much Bitcoin \u2014 only 3.125 new coins every 10 minutes, down from 6.25. That translates to almost $30 million worth of coins that will no longer enter circulation on a daily basis. Market participants love halvings, because they lower the supply of Bitcoin. If demand remains the same or increases, then Bitcoin\u2019s price will push higher \u2014 at least in theory. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, and this is Bitcoin\u2019s fourth one. The prior halvings were spectacular for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rallied roughly 1,800% within five months of its first halving in November 2012, and 3,000% a year and a half after the halving in July 2016. Its third halving in May 2020 had a more modest effect, but Bitcoin still surged almost 600% in 11 months. But this halving may play out differently. Because of the halving, Bitcoin miners aren\u2019t able to sell as much Bitcoin as before to finance their operational costs. Fewer sellers means buyers have a larger impact, at least theoretically. But miners play a smaller role in Bitcoin\u2019s price action than they used to. Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply of almost 19.7 million coins means that 93% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined. When the first two halvings happened \u2014 in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 the existing supply accounted for only 47% and 74% of the total supply, respectively. Put differently, this time around, the halving will make a smaller difference. Other factors this time pack a bigger punch when it comes to driving Bitcoin\u2019s price. They include $12 billion in new investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical conflict driving investors into havens and away from risky assets. Bitcoin is considered to be a risky asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by miners. Their job is to add new blocks to the blockchain and make sure no one is tampering with it. It\u2019s not an easy task. Miners need computational power to create new blocks. The more power they have, the more likely they are to mint new blocks before their competitors do. However, the more computer power they plug in, the higher their energy costs. That\u2019s why miners receive a certain amount of Bitcoin, plus transaction fees, every time they succeed in creating a new block. But for philosophical and economic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted Bitcoin to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Halvings were designed to decrease the creation of new Bitcoin over time until that target is reached in the year 2140. So each halving slashes in half the amount of Bitcoin that rolls into the market on a daily basis, gradually slowing the expansion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. The halving can make a huge dent in a miner\u2019s revenue, depending on its business model. If a mining operation isn\u2019t efficient enough \u2014 for example, it is locked in expensive electricity contracts with its energy providers \u2014 it can go under.

                "headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs will test Chinese restrictions on crypto investing with billions at stake",
                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Crypto: The Game combines elements of \"Survivor\" with crypto, creating a competitive arena where players vie for a grand prize of 72 Ether.\nEntries for the second season, named Anon Island, have already sold out in under 15 minutes.\nEntry and participation are facilitated through NFTs, tradeable on secondary markets, with the game operating on Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network.",
                "body": " Crypto: The Game, a game inspired by the popular TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d and developed by HQ Trivia founder Dylan Abruscato, has sold out all of the entries for its second season, dubbed Anon Island, which begins on April 8. Pseudonymous user MFL took home 41 Ether, about $100,000, last time. Now, the stakes are even higher. All 800 entries for season two were sold in less than 15 minutes, accumulating a prize pool of 72 Ether, about $250,000, for the participants. Crypto: The Game takes a 10% cut on the prize pool for operations. This season introduces a significant update that allows game entries, represented by NFTs, to be traded on platforms like OpenSea. With initial entries sold out, buying a ticket on the NFT marketplace is now the only way to start playing. After its launch on April 2, the price of the NFTs shot up as high as 0.4 Ether, an over 300% gain, before stabilising at around 0.135 Ether. The collection has since generated over 20 Ether in total volume. Anon Island organises participants into 10 colour-coded tribes, with entry secured through the purchase of an NFT for 0.1 Ether \u2014 a fee that grows the cumulative prize pool \u2014 or by acquiring an NFT on a marketplace. Although the initial fee to enter is around $320 at current prices \u2014 a high price point for many users \u2014 Absucato told DL News that this is by design. The game functions better with a smaller player pool as thousands of players would present logistical challenges, he said. The high entry fee also helps to ensure a larger prize pool for players. In the 10-day game, tribes compete in daily challenges that range from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts. The winning tribe of each day\u2019s challenge is granted immunity, protecting all its members from elimination that day. Members of the losing tribes must then participate in a vote to decide who will be eliminated, with the person receiving the most votes being removed from the competition. Outside of winning challenges, players can also avoid elimination by persuasively garnering support from their peers, a strategy that allows for immunity through alliances and negotiation. After a player is eliminated, their \u201cplayer\u201d NFT morphs into a \u201cjuror\u201d NFT, enabling holders of these jury tokens to stay active in the game. As the game advances and the number of players dwindles, the tribes combine. This leads to the climactic moment where the collective jury of eliminated contestants determines the victor of the game The grand prize, a substantial sum of 72 Ether \u2014 equivalent to around $240,000 \u2014 is awarded to the winner, marking the end of the game. Season one of Crypto: The Game drew 411 players, climaxing with user MFL clinching the $100,000 grand prize. Reflecting on the inaugural season\u2019s success and the lessons learned, the game\u2019s developers have introduced some changes for season two. One update is the game\u2019s migration to Base, whose founder, Jesse Pollack, has also joined the game. Base \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain incubated by centralised exchange Coinbase \u2014 is one of the fastest-growing layer 2 blockchains. The introduction of NFTs is designed to bring new dynamics to the game. It gives players the flexibility to sell their entry as stakes rise or purchase juror NFTs to maintain influence. This flexibility introduces intriguing possibilities, such as a player nearing the final stages opting to sell their entry on platforms like OpenSea, thus securing a guaranteed profit rather than facing potential elimination. Abruscato advises players to exercise caution when purchasing juror NFTs, addressing concerns to DL News about potential strategic manipulation through their accumulation, as he said season two will have numerous unexpected twists.

                "keypoints": "The Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub is launching what it calls its most ambitious project yet for cross-border payments.\nA group of seven central banks hope to work with private financial firms to leverage smart contracts.\nThe technology would help banks settle payments on blockchains.\nThe news comes as Wall Street giants like BlackRock also eye the $14 trillion potential of tokenising assets.",
                "body": " Wall Street giants like BlackRock are excited about the potential of tokenisation to automate the plumbing of financial markets. And central banks want a slice of that pie too. The Bank for International Settlements is giving its cross-border payments systems an overhaul, in what it calls its most ambitious project yet. The BIS, the Basel-based global forum of central banks, sees tokenising central bank money and deposits to leverage smart contracts as key to this transformation. On Wednesday, it launched a blueprint for a project aiming to harness smart contracts to speed up the services central banks offer to global financial institutions. \u201cTokenisation is the next frontier in terms of the digitalisation of money and payments,\u201d BIS Innovation Hub head Cecilia Skingsley said at a press briefing on Wednesday. The BIS is hoping that smart contracts, which enable automated transactions when conditions are met on a blockchain, can speed up the heavy-footed process for banks to make cross-border payments. Seven central banks are jumping on the new project dubbed \u201cAgor\u00e1\u201d by the BIS Innovation Hub. These include the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the French central bank representing the eurozone, as well as the central banks of Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Switzerland. Commercial financial firms may also join, but the BIS has no confirmation of participants yet. It will open a call for interest in the coming weeks, Skingsley said. Project Agor\u00e1 comes as the tokenisation buzz is growing, with governments, regulators and financial institutions investigating how blockchain technology can make markets more efficient. The US, UK and the European Union are among the jurisdictions offering experimental playgrounds for institutions to test out how tokenised financial instruments could work on blockchain under a regulatory microscope. Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street giant BlackRock \u2014 fresh off the wild success of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds \u2014 has said his true goal is \u201cthe tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d And consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates that tokenised assets could top at $14 trillion worth by 2030 in the private sector in a 2023 report. While these efforts have had some initial success, they\u2019re being done in isolation, the BIS says. Tokenisation projects \u201chave been hampered by the silos erected by each project and the resulting disconnect from other parts of the financial system,\u201d the BIS said in a 2023 report. Project Agor\u00e1 aims to bring more integration of the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. You may think of central banks as primarily the entities that lower or raise interest rates, as monetary policy is their most public function. But central banks also facilitate the massive transactions that financial institutions engage in daily. They provide so-called \u201cfinal settlement\u201d for these transactions, ensuring the buyer gets their asset and the seller gets their money. Central banks do this in their own money, which ensures that everyone gets paid at par even if they\u2019re using different currencies. Achieving final settlement is easier said than done. Different systems have to talk to each other via messaging protocols. With Agor\u00e1, the BIS hopes to unify all these systems \u2014 clearing, settlement, messaging \u2014 into unified ledgers, eliminating delays and uncertainty. Under the project, central banks would tokenise their own money, creating central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. That would ensure that settlement still occurred at par. And on the financial institutions\u2019 end, their deposits and assets would be tokenised, with properties and instructions encoded in underlying smart contracts. While blockchain promoters say the tech broadly promises to remove intermediaries, the BIS has contrasting goals. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and economic adviser, said at the briefing Wednesday. The project comes as the BIS worries that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies threaten to usurp some of the functions central banks perform in the global financial system. While crypto shows the potential of tokenisation, the BIS said last year that crypto \u201cis a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.\u201d It also \u201clacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank,\u201d the BIS said. Along with making payment processes more efficient, that\u2019s why central banks are steadily moving towards claiming blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Hong Kong is accepting spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nCrypto watchers expect the new funds could be approved before the end of June despite a mainland China crypto ban.",
                "body": " Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have helped drive Bitcoin\u2019s rally in 2024 \u2014 and Hong Kong may be next in line for a batch of ETFs. Hong Kong could list spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. \u201cThis would be a very big deal,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of research at Genesis, wrote in her \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter on Saturday. While mainland China continues to warn against cryptocurrency speculation, Hong Kong has warmed up towards virtual asset products. In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission said they would consider applications for spot crypto ETFs. If approved, the new ETFs would grant Hong Kong retail investors exposure to crypto. An approval before the end of June \u201cwill coincide with the launch of crypto spot ETNs on the London Stock Exchange, although these will only be offered to institutional investors, which limits the likely impact,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cWe will probably look back on 2024 as the Year of the Crypto ETFs,\u201d Acheson wrote. Acheson highlighted the Asian market\u2019s growing interest in Bitcoin amid this year\u2019s rally, which has seen Bitcoin break new all-time highs to above $73,000. Monthly volume for Asian spot crypto exchanges stands at about $1.5 trillion, eight times bigger than the $188 billion seen in the US, Acheson said. Even so, she noted that \u201cvolumes do not necessarily translate into fund inflows\u201d and that the region\u2019s reputation as a centre for so-called wash trading should raise concerns about the legitimacy of a lot of those trades. \u201cBut the relative weight does suggest a greater familiarity with and interest in crypto assets, even if only as a vehicle for speculation,\u201d Acheson added. Still, Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs face a few unique challenges. ETFs are a relatively new market in Asia, with the region only seeing $20 billion in average daily trading volume compared to the $166 billion seen in the US, Acheson said, quoting figures from the last quarter of 2023. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen daily trading volumes exceed $3 billion since their January launch. The Chinese government\u2019s ongoing opposition to crypto in general is another possible roadblock to ETF approval, according to Acheson. Despite headwinds, Acheson sees a positive global outlook for Bitcoin ETFs \u201cat a time when the case for long-term positions as a hedge against currency debasement becomes even clearer.\u201d Tyler Pearson is a junior markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months for breaking US banking law",
                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

                "body": " The Bitcoin halving has so far failed to produce any significant jumps in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks. The exchange repeatedly postponed bankruptcy proceedings for over a decade, but its creditors could finally be about to get back the almost 142,000 Bitcoin they\u2019re owed from the collapse. The bad news? Almost $9.2 billion worth of the cryptocurrency could hit the market any time before October 31, the deadline for the Mt. Gox repayments. That \u201cwill weigh on the market,\u201d Brian Redick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, the decline has been pushed back several times in the past, and creditors could opt to hold the cryptocurrency rather than selling it on day one. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin halving just happened \u2014 here\u2019s what it means",
                "keypoints": "The Bitcoin halving happened in the first hours of Saturday, London time.\nThe impact is huge for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nBut what it means for Bitcoin\u2019s price is more nuanced.",
                "body": " It finally happened. The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry, occurred in the first hours of Saturday, London time. From now on, the network will create half as much Bitcoin \u2014 only 3.125 new coins every 10 minutes, down from 6.25. That translates to almost $30 million worth of coins that will no longer enter circulation on a daily basis. Market participants love halvings, because they lower the supply of Bitcoin. If demand remains the same or increases, then Bitcoin\u2019s price will push higher \u2014 at least in theory. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, and this is Bitcoin\u2019s fourth one. The prior halvings were spectacular for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rallied roughly 1,800% within five months of its first halving in November 2012, and 3,000% a year and a half after the halving in July 2016. Its third halving in May 2020 had a more modest effect, but Bitcoin still surged almost 600% in 11 months. But this halving may play out differently. Because of the halving, Bitcoin miners aren\u2019t able to sell as much Bitcoin as before to finance their operational costs. Fewer sellers means buyers have a larger impact, at least theoretically. But miners play a smaller role in Bitcoin\u2019s price action than they used to. Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply of almost 19.7 million coins means that 93% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined. When the first two halvings happened \u2014 in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 the existing supply accounted for only 47% and 74% of the total supply, respectively. Put differently, this time around, the halving will make a smaller difference. Other factors this time pack a bigger punch when it comes to driving Bitcoin\u2019s price. They include $12 billion in new investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical conflict driving investors into havens and away from risky assets. Bitcoin is considered to be a risky asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by miners. Their job is to add new blocks to the blockchain and make sure no one is tampering with it. It\u2019s not an easy task. Miners need computational power to create new blocks. The more power they have, the more likely they are to mint new blocks before their competitors do. However, the more computer power they plug in, the higher their energy costs. That\u2019s why miners receive a certain amount of Bitcoin, plus transaction fees, every time they succeed in creating a new block. But for philosophical and economic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted Bitcoin to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Halvings were designed to decrease the creation of new Bitcoin over time until that target is reached in the year 2140. So each halving slashes in half the amount of Bitcoin that rolls into the market on a daily basis, gradually slowing the expansion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. The halving can make a huge dent in a miner\u2019s revenue, depending on its business model. If a mining operation isn\u2019t efficient enough \u2014 for example, it is locked in expensive electricity contracts with its energy providers \u2014 it can go under. This has caused analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase and research firm Bernstein to predict that the mining industry will consolidate, as big players scoop up struggling rivals. Marathon Digital and Hut 8, two of the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms in the US, have told DL News that they are looking for opportunities to buy distressed assets. \u201cWe\u2019re ready and willing to acquire assets if the right assets come up at the right price,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said.

                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. The governance token for Uniswap, UNI, is down 36% since Wednesday, while Ether is down 13% in the same period. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "headline": "Renzo leans into layer 2s to boost market share, with more integrations on the way",
                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks. The exchange repeatedly postponed bankruptcy proceedings for over a decade, but its creditors could finally be about to get back the almost 142,000 Bitcoin they\u2019re owed from the collapse.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin halving just happened \u2014 here\u2019s what it means",
                "keypoints": "The Bitcoin halving happened in the first hours of Saturday, London time.\nThe impact is huge for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nBut what it means for Bitcoin\u2019s price is more nuanced.",
                "body": " It finally happened. The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry, occurred in the first hours of Saturday, London time. From now on, the network will create half as much Bitcoin \u2014 only 3.125 new coins every 10 minutes, down from 6.25. That translates to almost $30 million worth of coins that will no longer enter circulation on a daily basis. Market participants love halvings, because they lower the supply of Bitcoin. If demand remains the same or increases, then Bitcoin\u2019s price will push higher \u2014 at least in theory. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, and this is Bitcoin\u2019s fourth one. The prior halvings were spectacular for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rallied roughly 1,800% within five months of its first halving in November 2012, and 3,000% a year and a half after the halving in July 2016. Its third halving in May 2020 had a more modest effect, but Bitcoin still surged almost 600% in 11 months. But this halving may play out differently. Because of the halving, Bitcoin miners aren\u2019t able to sell as much Bitcoin as before to finance their operational costs. Fewer sellers means buyers have a larger impact, at least theoretically. But miners play a smaller role in Bitcoin\u2019s price action than they used to. Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply of almost 19.7 million coins means that 93% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined. When the first two halvings happened \u2014 in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 the existing supply accounted for only 47% and 74% of the total supply, respectively. Put differently, this time around, the halving will make a smaller difference. Other factors this time pack a bigger punch when it comes to driving Bitcoin\u2019s price. They include $12 billion in new investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical conflict driving investors into havens and away from risky assets. Bitcoin is considered to be a risky asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by miners. Their job is to add new blocks to the blockchain and make sure no one is tampering with it. It\u2019s not an easy task. Miners need computational power to create new blocks. The more power they have, the more likely they are to mint new blocks before their competitors do. However, the more computer power they plug in, the higher their energy costs. That\u2019s why miners receive a certain amount of Bitcoin, plus transaction fees, every time they succeed in creating a new block. But for philosophical and economic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted Bitcoin to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Halvings were designed to decrease the creation of new Bitcoin over time until that target is reached in the year 2140. So each halving slashes in half the amount of Bitcoin that rolls into the market on a daily basis, gradually slowing the expansion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. The halving can make a huge dent in a miner\u2019s revenue, depending on its business model. If a mining operation isn\u2019t efficient enough \u2014 for example, it is locked in expensive electricity contracts with its energy providers \u2014 it can go under. This has caused analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase and research firm Bernstein to predict that the mining industry will consolidate, as big players scoop up struggling rivals. Marathon Digital and Hut 8, two of the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms in the US, have told DL News that they are looking for opportunities to buy distressed assets. \u201cWe\u2019re ready and willing to acquire assets if the right assets come up at the right price,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said.

                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Last week, Uniswap Labs raised its fee for those who swap through the Uniswap website to 0.25% from 0.1%.\nThe user-interface fee has generated over $16 million in cumulative fees since Uniswap Labs first implemented the fee last October.\nThe higher fee may help Uniswap Labs pay for its possible legal fight with the SEC, after the agency indicated last week it may sue the decentralised exchange.",
                "body": " Uniswap Labs raked in a daily all-time high in fees of around $727,000 from its 0.25% swap fee Saturday, the same day Iran\u2019s missile and drone strikes on Israel contributed to extreme volatility in the crypto markets. But the higher fee may have already driven some traders away from the platform, raising the question of whether more will go to other exchanges. Still, it\u2019s too early to tell. Uniswap is a decentralised exchange and Uniswap Labs is the company that builds and maintains Uniswap. Uniswap Labs first implemented a fee for swaps on October 16. The fees have generated a cumulative $16.2 million in revenue. The fee, referred to as the user interface swap fee, charges users a fee if they swap directly through the Uniswap website; if a trader swaps through an aggregator, they don\u2019t pay the fee. The user-interface is in addition to regular trading fees on Uniswap, which range from 0.01% to 1%. Uniswap has been the leading decentralised exchange by volume over the past seven days, posting a total volume of $21.7 billion. This makes the fee increase particularly noteworthy, as it raises questions about how much revenue it could generate and whether it might prompt users to trade elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs increased its user-interface swap fee to 0.25% on all trading pairs except on stablecoin pairs and wrapping Ether, up from the previous 0.1% fee that was applied to only 10 different tokens. Also, last Wednesday, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC, quickly declaring it is \u201cready to fight\u201d in this case. The exchange\u2019s stance has led some analysts to assume that the fee increase is intended to support the platform\u2019s likely legal battle. Uniswap was also planning to vote on a different fee switch proposal this month, one that would see fees returned to UNI stakers. It is unclear whether the vote will still take place after it was revealed Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice, which is often an indication that the SEC will sue. On April 5, the protocol hit a milestone of over $2 trillion in cumulative volume, and despite the additional 0.25% fee implemented, last Friday was the fourth-highest volume day for Uniswap in 2024. Last Tuesday, the day before the implementation of the 0.25% fee, Uniswap had about 285,000 unique traders. By Sunday, the number had dropped 15% to around 241,000. That might be because users chose to swap elsewhere due to the higher fee, although it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Renzo\u2019s ezETH token added 30%, or $730 million, to its total supply in the last seven days.\nThe total ezETH supply on layer 2 blockchains is $680 million, compared with the $428 million eETH from competitor Ether.fi.\nThe battle for market share will only heat up as EigenLayer recently launched its mainnet as further leveraged farming integrations are on the horizon.",
                "body": " Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a liquid restaking, or LRT, token, added 30% to its total supply in the last seven days to gain market share in the competitive LRT sector. Restaking is a novel concept introduced by the Ethereum-based protocol EigenLayer that extends the security of Ethereum validators to other protocols. Renzo, and other restaking protocols, let users deposit their staked Ether into EigenLayer. In return, users receive a receipt token, known as an LRT, that can be used elsewhere in DeFi. According to data from DefiLlama, while Renzo added $460 million in deposits on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, an additional $270 million was added to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s in the last seven days. Consequently, layer 2s now account for $680 million of the ezETH, within a broader total supply of $2.96 billion across all blockchains. Renzo\u2019s main competitor, Ether.fi\u2019s eETH, leads in total value deposited, with a current total supply of $3.8 billion, but only around $428 million of that is on layer 2 networks. Market share of the top liquid restaking protocols (Dune: Hashed Official) Layer 2 networks offer users the benefit of reduced transaction fees, as well as opportunities to earn additional points. Points are a tool designed to incentivize people to use a protocol. For example, Renzo gives users points each day if they hold ezETH. Similar strategies are used by other DeFi protocols. Typically, these points convert to tokens at a later date. For Ether.fi the first conversion of points to tokens happened on March 15. Renzo still hasn\u2019t converted points to tokens. Both Ether.fi and Renzo have a big presence on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer 2 by total value of crypto assets deposited, with 120,136 eETH and 75,257 ezETH on the blockchain. Mode, an Ethereum layer 2 built using the Optimism SDK, is another popular choice for LRT holders, but here, ezETH outweighs eETH, with 38,743 ezETH and 2,232 eETH. Mode offers ezETH depositors double the Mode points, playing a role in the outsized deposits. Still, Renzo\u2019s most important integration may be with Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 that offers a native yield on deposits. On Blast, ezETH users can deposit in Juice, a \u201cleverage farming\u201d protocol that allows users to leverage their deposits to earn more points through Juice\u2019s vaults. Vaults are smart contracts that perform specific DeFi strategies. A handful of vaults on Juice use ezETH, but the largest is the wETH/ezETH V3 LP vault, which currently has about $144 million deposited in it. Total USD value of ezETH on Blast This specific strategy provides liquidity on Thruster, a decentralised exchange on Blast, and then stakes that position on Hyperlock, a yield optimiser. In doing so, users can expect to earn points from Renzo, EigenLayer, Hyperlock, Thruster, Juice, and Blast. Still, it should be noted, this daisy chain of points involves significant risks, as deposits are routed through multiple protocols, in addition to the risk of liquidation. The battle for market share will only continue to heat up, as EigenLayer launched its highly anticipated mainnet on Tuesday. Also, this week, Juice announced that it will be integrating eETH into its vaults, and Gearbox, a leverage farming protocol on Ethereum mainnet, announced it will integrate ezETH on Arbitrum for leveraged point farming, the first such market on Arbitrum.

                "keypoints": "Glassnode says surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows mark new phase.\nIn past cycles Bitcoin has dropped 10% or more even amid optimism.\nEuphoria period will eventually give way to a new stage, research shows.",
                "body": " Cue the euphoria. With Bitcoin blowing past $70,000 earlier this week, investors are optimistic that the bull market is just getting started. That\u2019s the take from data provider Glassnode, which said Monday that surging spot trading volumes and robust exchange flows have ushered in a new stage in the market cycle. \u201cWealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective,\u201d Glassnode wrote in a report. Still, there is reason for caution given crypto\u2019s volatility. In prior euphoric periods, prices have dropped more than 10% and even 25% even as optimism was running full tilt, the data provider said in a report. Data shows that this market cycle has only experienced two corrections of approximately 10% or more this year, one in mid-March and another at the beginning of April. Bitcoin was trading at just north of $69,000 in mid-morning trading UK time on Wednesday. Euphoria in the cryptocurrency market typically signals a peak in optimism, with investors showing increased confidence in future price movements, Glassnode said. Looking at past trends, the current excitement in the market is likely just beginning, Glassnode said. Such phases are often characterised by significant increases in trading activity and a general willingness among investors to take on more risk in anticipation of higher returns. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably in the fourth to sixth inning,\u201d David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get rocky sometimes, though.\u201d The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last year has been significantly bolstered by heightened spot trading activity and an uptick in the movement of Bitcoin across exchanges, Glassnode wrote. Daily trading volumes peaked at $14.1 billion for Bitcoin in mid-March, mirroring the peak trading activity seen during the 2020-2021 bull market, the analysis found. The market has been influenced by the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin on January 11, which broadened investor participation. Following the euphoria phase, the market typically moves into the distribution phase, where early investors start selling their holdings to take profits. This leads to increased volatility and a shift in market sentiment from optimism to caution. Recent weeks have seen a cooling off, with volumes adjusting to around $7 billion daily (down from $14 billion), hinting at a possible moderation in market activity, Glassnode said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins threaten to privatise key roles that central banks play in the financial system.\nA new project from a group of central banks aims to fight back.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter on April 8. Sign up here. GM, Joanna here. Central banks worry about the increasingly crowded stablecoin field. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert spoke to Ripple CTO David Schwartz about the company\u2019s planned launch of a stablecoin, a venture that will compete with Circle and PayPal\u2019s dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Aleks writes that stablecoins \u201care one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world,\u201d with Bernstein analysts predicting that the market will hit $3 trillion by 2028. That\u2019s threatening to central banks on several fronts, including cross-border payments. Central banks facilitate massive transactions daily in government-issued currencies between international financial institutions. Stablecoins threaten to usurp and privatise this payments function. The Bank of International Settlements \u2014 a financial institution owned by most of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 just moved to shore up central banks\u2019 dominance with a project called Agor\u00e1. Agor\u00e1 aims to tokenise both central bank money \u2014 as a so-called \u201cwholesale CBDC\u201d \u2014 and commercial bank deposits in order to facilitate cross-border payments on the blockchain. While this project is nascent \u2014 no commercial banks have signed on \u2014 it reveals its member banks\u2019 worries. Even as the BIS hopes that Agor\u00e1 brings faster payments for banks, it\u2019s also looking to maintain central banks\u2019 middleman role. \u201cOur goal is to perfect the role of intermediaries in the international monetary system,\u201d Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research and an economic adviser, said during a news conference last week. Arguably, that\u2019s a good thing. The BIS says using central bank money in cross-border finance maintains a level playing field between parties using different currencies or types of money, protecting them from fluctuations in exchange rates. For suppliers of e-money tokens, this kind of project is about shoring up the status quo \u2014 the supremacy of banks in the financial system that crypto once threatened to disrupt. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder of e-money issuer Monerium, told me that banks realise they\u2019re threatened by tokens that make payments relatively frictionless. While it makes sense for commercial banks to maintain their dominance, central banks should not be favouring one group of competitors over another, said Egilsson, a former chair of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland. Central banks \u201care a public institution, and their aim is to make sure there is financial stability and that inflation is OK,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cIs it the role of a public institution to increase the competitiveness of banks? Maybe, but then they should support the other group equally.\u201d Email me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have found the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin maxis will save the crypto rally from Mt. Gox\u2019s $9bn sell-off",
                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin halving just happened \u2014 here\u2019s what it means",
                "keypoints": "The Bitcoin halving happened in the first hours of Saturday, London time.\nThe impact is huge for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nBut what it means for Bitcoin\u2019s price is more nuanced.",
                "body": " It finally happened. The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry, occurred in the first hours of Saturday, London time. From now on, the network will create half as much Bitcoin \u2014 only 3.125 new coins every 10 minutes, down from 6.25. That translates to almost $30 million worth of coins that will no longer enter circulation on a daily basis. Market participants love halvings, because they lower the supply of Bitcoin. If demand remains the same or increases, then Bitcoin\u2019s price will push higher \u2014 at least in theory. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, and this is Bitcoin\u2019s fourth one. The prior halvings were spectacular for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rallied roughly 1,800% within five months of its first halving in November 2012, and 3,000% a year and a half after the halving in July 2016. Its third halving in May 2020 had a more modest effect, but Bitcoin still surged almost 600% in 11 months. But this halving may play out differently. Because of the halving, Bitcoin miners aren\u2019t able to sell as much Bitcoin as before to finance their operational costs. Fewer sellers means buyers have a larger impact, at least theoretically. But miners play a smaller role in Bitcoin\u2019s price action than they used to. Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply of almost 19.7 million coins means that 93% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined. When the first two halvings happened \u2014 in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 the existing supply accounted for only 47% and 74% of the total supply, respectively. Put differently, this time around, the halving will make a smaller difference. Other factors this time pack a bigger punch when it comes to driving Bitcoin\u2019s price. They include $12 billion in new investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical conflict driving investors into havens and away from risky assets. Bitcoin is considered to be a risky asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by miners. Their job is to add new blocks to the blockchain and make sure no one is tampering with it. It\u2019s not an easy task. Miners need computational power to create new blocks. The more power they have, the more likely they are to mint new blocks before their competitors do. However, the more computer power they plug in, the higher their energy costs. That\u2019s why miners receive a certain amount of Bitcoin, plus transaction fees, every time they succeed in creating a new block. But for philosophical and economic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted Bitcoin to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Halvings were designed to decrease the creation of new Bitcoin over time until that target is reached in the year 2140. So each halving slashes in half the amount of Bitcoin that rolls into the market on a daily basis, gradually slowing the expansion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. The halving can make a huge dent in a miner\u2019s revenue, depending on its business model. If a mining operation isn\u2019t efficient enough \u2014 for example, it is locked in expensive electricity contracts with its energy providers \u2014 it can go under. This has caused analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase and research firm Bernstein to predict that the mining industry will consolidate, as big players scoop up struggling rivals. Marathon Digital and Hut 8, two of the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms in the US, have told DL News that they are looking for opportunities to buy distressed assets. \u201cWe\u2019re ready and willing to acquire assets if the right assets come up at the right price,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said.

                "headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs will test Chinese restrictions on crypto investing with billions at stake",
                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "headline": "Angry investors say ZKasino stole $30m in crypto as Dutch police make arrest linked to scam",
                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Friend.tech token plummets on first day after 100% community airdrop",
                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "headline": "Hong Kong just opened six Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from three China-linked issuers",
                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Scroll enabled blobs on its blockchain, dropping the median transaction fee to $0.15 from $0.62.\nThe platform recently introduced a point programme, helping the total value of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain to break all-time highs.\nScroll is still the second-most expensive layer 2 network for transactions, but with further upgrades, fees may fall further.",
                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "The Bitcoin halving just happened \u2014 here\u2019s what it means",
                "keypoints": "The Bitcoin halving happened in the first hours of Saturday, London time.\nThe impact is huge for the Bitcoin mining industry.\nBut what it means for Bitcoin\u2019s price is more nuanced.",
                "body": " It finally happened. The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry, occurred in the first hours of Saturday, London time. From now on, the network will create half as much Bitcoin \u2014 only 3.125 new coins every 10 minutes, down from 6.25. That translates to almost $30 million worth of coins that will no longer enter circulation on a daily basis. Market participants love halvings, because they lower the supply of Bitcoin. If demand remains the same or increases, then Bitcoin\u2019s price will push higher \u2014 at least in theory. Halvings are scheduled to occur roughly every four years, and this is Bitcoin\u2019s fourth one. The prior halvings were spectacular for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rallied roughly 1,800% within five months of its first halving in November 2012, and 3,000% a year and a half after the halving in July 2016. Its third halving in May 2020 had a more modest effect, but Bitcoin still surged almost 600% in 11 months. But this halving may play out differently. Because of the halving, Bitcoin miners aren\u2019t able to sell as much Bitcoin as before to finance their operational costs. Fewer sellers means buyers have a larger impact, at least theoretically. But miners play a smaller role in Bitcoin\u2019s price action than they used to. Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply of almost 19.7 million coins means that 93% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined. When the first two halvings happened \u2014 in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 the existing supply accounted for only 47% and 74% of the total supply, respectively. Put differently, this time around, the halving will make a smaller difference. Other factors this time pack a bigger punch when it comes to driving Bitcoin\u2019s price. They include $12 billion in new investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Federal Reserve policy, and geopolitical conflict driving investors into havens and away from risky assets. Bitcoin is considered to be a risky asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by miners. Their job is to add new blocks to the blockchain and make sure no one is tampering with it. It\u2019s not an easy task. Miners need computational power to create new blocks. The more power they have, the more likely they are to mint new blocks before their competitors do. However, the more computer power they plug in, the higher their energy costs. That\u2019s why miners receive a certain amount of Bitcoin, plus transaction fees, every time they succeed in creating a new block. But for philosophical and economic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted Bitcoin to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Halvings were designed to decrease the creation of new Bitcoin over time until that target is reached in the year 2140. So each halving slashes in half the amount of Bitcoin that rolls into the market on a daily basis, gradually slowing the expansion of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. The halving can make a huge dent in a miner\u2019s revenue, depending on its business model. If a mining operation isn\u2019t efficient enough \u2014 for example, it is locked in expensive electricity contracts with its energy providers \u2014 it can go under. This has caused analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase and research firm Bernstein to predict that the mining industry will consolidate, as big players scoop up struggling rivals. Marathon Digital and Hut 8, two of the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms in the US, have told DL News that they are looking for opportunities to buy distressed assets. \u201cWe\u2019re ready and willing to acquire assets if the right assets come up at the right price,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said.

                "keypoints": "The advent of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether in Hong Kong is raising hopes about China's crypto demand.\nA couple of Chinese asset management firms are in the mix.\nSome analysts say demand may not materialise.",
                "body": " When Hong Kong approved the rollout of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 15, one of the most significant implications was whether access for mainland Chinese investors would be possible. This is potentially huge because Chinese crypto investors have been barred from speculating in the market since 2021. If mainlanders can start pouring money into the market, well, that would be a deep new source of liquidity. Alessio Quaglini, co-founder and CEO of Hex Trust, told DL News earlier this week that Hong Kong\u2019s embrace of crypto could unlock billions in potential demand. \u201cWhile the official stance on mainland investor participation remains unclear, China\u2019s recent interest in alternative assets, like gold, suggests a potential appetite for Bitcoin exposure,\u201d Quaglini said. The catch? It\u2019s not clear if restrictions against Chinese investment in crypto will extend to ETFs. If restrictions do not apply to the ETFs, this could be the key that unlocks a gusher of new investment capital. But that\u2019s a big if. The process of turning Hong Kong\u2019s plan into a practical blueprint for asset managers is only beginning. Eric Balchunas, for one, isn\u2019t so sure China is going to be okay with this new route for speculation. This week, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence warned investors not to count on a heavy mainland Chinese inflow into Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin funds. \u201cWe think they\u2019ll be lucky to get $500m,\u201d Balchunas said on X. \u201cIf Chinese investors start buying and the govt doesn\u2019t crack down that could change things but as far as we know the govt ban on Bitcoin will include the ETFs,\u201d he said. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. Still, Hong Kong and the mainland have operated a cross-border programme for investing in financial products, including ETFs, for around a decade. The connect programme requires certain criteria to be met by ETFs, including being listed for at least six months, and maintaining a daily average of assets under management of at least HKD 1.7 billion (US$217 million), according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. That said, investment restrictions around cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t stopped China\u2019s citizens much in the past. Between July 2022 and June 2023, $86.4 billion in raw transaction volumes came from the Chinese market, according to Chainalysis. Even if Chinese investors are locked out, the potential Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have strong links to mainland China. The providers that have received approval for the Bitcoin and Ether offerings, Harvest Global, Bosera, and China Asset Management, are mainland Chinese companies with offices in Hong Kong. In Harvest Global\u2019s case, the ETF approval has come even as it has started to wind down its overseas offerings and shifted more to helping mainland Chinese invest abroad. In January this year, it cut its Hong Kong staff by half, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is minimally a strong signal that at least the mainland is tolerant of this,\u201d HB Lim, managing director APAC at BitGo told DL News. \u201cWhether or not to open it up for local Chinese citizens to trade is a different thing.\u201d Callan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

                "headline": "More DeFi protocols could snub US users as crypto airdrops explode",
                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "headline": "Why bulls believe Bitcoin ETFs will hit $100bn in assets later this year",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

                "keypoints": "The halving cut the supply of new Bitcoin hitting the market.\nDespite high demand, the cryptocurrency has failed to rally since.\nThe reason could be a $9.2 billion threat that\u2019s loomed over the industry for years.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving has so far failed to produce any significant jumps in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks. The exchange repeatedly postponed bankruptcy proceedings for over a decade, but its creditors could finally be about to get back the almost 142,000 Bitcoin they\u2019re owed from the collapse. The bad news? Almost $9.2 billion worth of the cryptocurrency could hit the market any time before October 31, the deadline for the Mt. Gox repayments. That \u201cwill weigh on the market,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, the decline has been pushed back several times in the past, and creditors could opt to hold the cryptocurrency rather than selling it on day one. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News. He was referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. He also noted that while $9.2 billion sounds like a large number, Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Other factors affecting the price of Bitcoin include stubborn inflation, and tension in the Middle East.

                "headline": "Mining revenue soared 200% in wake of \u2018abnormal\u2019 Bitcoin memecoin trading frenzy. But will it last?",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "More DeFi protocols could snub US users as crypto airdrops explode",
                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin maxis will save the crypto rally from Mt. Gox\u2019s $9bn sell-off",
                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

                "body": " The Bitcoin halving has so far failed to produce any significant jumps in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Concerns about the repayments to creditors, which appear set to begin in earnest soon, could \u201cconstrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after it was drained by a string of hacks. The exchange repeatedly postponed bankruptcy proceedings for over a decade, but its creditors could finally be about to get back the almost 142,000 Bitcoin they\u2019re owed from the collapse.

That \u201cwill weigh on the market,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, the decline has been pushed back several times in the past, and creditors could opt to hold the cryptocurrency rather than selling it on day one. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt.

                "headline": "Mining revenue soared 200% in wake of \u2018abnormal\u2019 Bitcoin memecoin trading frenzy. But will it last?",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "headline": "Angry investors say ZKasino stole $30m in crypto as Dutch police make arrest linked to scam",
                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "headline": "Hong Kong just opened six Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from three China-linked issuers",
                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Scroll enabled blobs on its blockchain, dropping the median transaction fee to $0.15 from $0.62.\nThe platform recently introduced a point programme, helping the total value of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain to break all-time highs.\nScroll is still the second-most expensive layer 2 network for transactions, but with further upgrades, fees may fall further.",
                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose about 12% on the back of the event, but has since fallen to trade around the $63,000 mark. A potential reason is a $9.2 billion threat that has loomed over the industry since 2014: the return of over $9 billion to creditors of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin trading fees spiked at the same time as the halving.\nRunes, a new protocol that allows traders to buy memecoins on Bitcoin, was the reason behind the activity.\nAgainst expectations, miners saw their revenue triple in the wake of the halving.",
                "body": " The Bitcoin halving occurred in the early hours of Saturday, London time. The event slashed in half the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners for maintaining the blockchain. Naturally, it should have severely decreased mining revenue. But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds.

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Scroll enabled blobs on its blockchain, dropping the median transaction fee to $0.15 from $0.62.\nThe platform recently introduced a point programme, helping the total value of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain to break all-time highs.\nScroll is still the second-most expensive layer 2 network for transactions, but with further upgrades, fees may fall further.",
                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

But a new Bitcoin token protocol, Runes, launched on the blockchain at the exact same time the halving happened, and it sent trading fees soaring. Miner revenue, instead of getting cut 50%, went up 200%, analysts from research firm Bernstein wrote on Monday. And while the spike was \u201cclearly abnormal,\u201d sustained network activity \u2014 and the interest from traders and developers it entails \u2014 could provide firm support for miner revenue in the future, Bernstein said. The Runes upgrade makes it easier for traders and developers to interact with tokens based on Bitcoin. Miners bagged roughly $78 million in trading fees the day Runes launched, a surge \u201cdriven by speculative activity to mint new tokens \u2014 mostly meme tokens \u2014 by retail traders,\u201d according to Bernstein. Bitcoin rewards, meanwhile, halved to $29 million per day, which means that transaction fees accounted for roughly 73% of miner revenue over the course of the day. Fees have since dropped to roughly $20 million per day, which is still a 170% increase from average daily fees in the week prior to the halving. As of this writing, transaction fees make up 40% of miner revenue, almost cancelling the effects of the halving on miners\u2019 bottom lines. Although that\u2019s good news for miners, the spike in fees made it more expensive for Bitcoin users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Transaction fees peaked at an all-time high average of $128 per transaction on Saturday, per BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than double the average fee at the previous peak, which came in April 2021 at the height of the previous bull market mania. And even though fees dropped back down to $34 per transaction on Sunday, they are still at their highest point in four months. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital said in February that a nascent Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could make up between 8% and 50% of Bitcoin\u2019s total value, if it follows the same blueprint as Ethereum. With Bitcoin at $1.3 trillion in value, that means a Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could potentially be worth anywhere between $100 billion and $650 billion. While Runes doesn\u2019t provide smart contract functionality and therefore cannot be used to build DeFi applications, it does give Bitcoin more utility and makes the blockchain more attractive for developers to build on it. \u201cAlthough Runes has launched with meme tokens, over time, we could see more utility based fungible tokens on Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein said. Sustained transaction activity could also have an impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. Analysts from crypto exchange Coinbase have warned that the halving could cause the mining industry to consolidate, with big players scooping up smaller, less efficient operations. That could end up having dire consequences for the Bitcoin network, because it could make the network more vulnerable to hostile takeovers. But the consolidation of the mining industry may be delayed or even prevented if transaction fees remain high or grow even further \u2014 because miners will be able to rely on those fees more than on Bitcoin rewards.

                "headline": "Pump.fun accounts for 83% of Solana token launches, pushing daily revenue over $1m",
                "keypoints": "Pump.fun makes trading and launching memecoins easier and safer.\nIt generated over $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana.\nOver 83% of newly launched tokens on Solana Tuesday were from Pump.fun.",
                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Daily active users and total transactions on Arbitrum reached new highs on Monday.\nYet Arbitrum\u2019s governance token is down 58% from its all-time high earlier in the year.\nArbitrum is still the top Ethereum layer 2 blockchain by total value of crypto assets, daily transactions, and daily active users.",
                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin maxis will save the crypto rally from Mt. Gox\u2019s $9bn sell-off",
                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "keypoints": "CryptoPunk #635 sold for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million.\nThis is the third alien CryptoPunk to sell this year, bringing the total to 12,940 Ether, around $45 million.\nWhile NFT volumes and floor prices continue to decline, rare NFTs seem to still be highly sought after.",
                "body": " One of nine alien CryptoPunks sold on Thursday for 4,000 Ether, around $12.5 million, in a trade facilitated by Fountain, a broker for high-value NFTs. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, pixelated profile pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT. NFTs are a type of digital collectible that use cryptography to verify their ownership and authenticity, serving as a digital proof of ownership. CryptoPunk #635, previously owned by Larva Labs, was last sold as part of a collection of nine CryptoPunks for just under $17 million, or 4,250 Ether, at auction house Christie\u2019s in May 2021. The identity of the latest investor remains unknown. This particular Punk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine that features the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection. CryptoPunk #635 The sale comes as earlier in the year two other CryptoPunks with alien traits were sold, bringing the yearly total for alien Punks to 12,940 Ether, or around $45 million. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 Ether, around $16 million, and on March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 sold for 4,850 Ether, around $16.5 million. CryptoPunk #635 had previously received an offer on March 5 for 4,440 Ether, around $16.4 million, but the offer was withdrawn on April 22. By not accepting this offer, the owner of CryptoPunk #635 missed out on around an extra potential profit of $4 million. But these transactions pale in comparison to the record-setting sale of CryptoPunk #5822, which occurred in February 2022. This Punk fetched a staggering 8,000 Ether \u2014 nearly $24 million at the time. Thursday\u2019s sale of CryptoPunk #635 is the latest in a series of alien Punk sales, following CryptoPunk #3100 earlier this year. This sale ended a 751-day drought in which no alien Punks were sold since CryptoPunk #5822 was purchased back in 2021. Despite the high-profile sales, the CryptoPunks collection has experienced a significant downturn since its peak in 2021. The minimum asking price, or floor price, for a CryptoPunk reached its peak at 113.9 Ether, about $408,000, on October 8, 2021, but has since declined to just 36.9 Ether, roughly $117,000 today. Daily floor price for the CryptoPunks collection (NFT Price Floor) The Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular NFT collection, also witnessed a dramatic shift in value. Its floor price surged to a high of 128 Ether on April 30, 2022, but has experienced a steep fall to 15.5 Ether.This trend of declining values is mirrored across the broader NFT market. Trading volumes soared to an all-time high on April 30, 2022, largely fueled by Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse project\u2019s NFT sale, generating over 200,000 Ether in trading volume in a single day. Since then, however, trading volumes have trended downward. The total daily volume, as per DefiLlama, has dropped by 99% to just 1,700 Ether as of Wednesday.

                "body": " Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for memecoin launches, suffered an attack on Thursday, with an estimated $2 million in losses. The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun makes trading and launching memecoins easier and safer.\nIt generated over $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana.\nOver 83% of newly launched tokens on Solana Tuesday were from Pump.fun.",
                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Scroll enabled blobs on its blockchain, dropping the median transaction fee to $0.15 from $0.62.\nThe platform recently introduced a point programme, helping the total value of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain to break all-time highs.\nScroll is still the second-most expensive layer 2 network for transactions, but with further upgrades, fees may fall further.",
                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "body": " Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for memecoin launches, suffered an attack on Thursday, with an estimated $2 million in losses. The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "headline": "More DeFi protocols could snub US users as crypto airdrops explode",
                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last? (@whale_hunter) PROPOSAL: Aave details ambitious \u201cAave 2030\u2033 plans, including major upgrade and rebrand VOTE: GMX considers ending multiplier points rewards VOTE: Rocket Pool mulls contributor stipends John Paul Koning weighs in on USDT issuer Tether\u2019s gargantuan first quarter profits.

Founder Rune Christensen believes Endgame will place Maker and its dollar-pegged, digital token DAI beyond the reach of any government, impossible to shut down or turn off.

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "headline": "Why bulls believe Bitcoin ETFs will hit $100bn in assets later this year",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months for breaking US banking law",
                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Scroll enabled blobs on its blockchain, dropping the median transaction fee to $0.15 from $0.62.\nThe platform recently introduced a point programme, helping the total value of crypto assets deposited on the blockchain to break all-time highs.\nScroll is still the second-most expensive layer 2 network for transactions, but with further upgrades, fees may fall further.",
                "body": " Scroll, an Ethereum layer 2 network, enabled \u201cblobs,\u201d a key feature of the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade, on its blockchain on Monday, dropping transaction fees on the network by around 75%. In the hours leading up to the upgrade, the median transaction fee on the network was about $0.62, and now it is around $0.15. Median transaction cost (USD) on the Scroll blockchain (Growthepie) Like with other layer 2 blockchains, lower fees may spur more activity. In line with that, Scroll introduced a points programme, dubbed Session Zero, to entice users to deposit on the blockchain. In this programme, users receive Scroll Marks for bridging Ether or wstETH via Scroll\u2019s native bridge or for bridging STONE using LayerZero. Users earn additional Marks by holding these assets on Scroll. It\u2019s expected that the Marks will convert to tokens at a later date, although that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Scroll team. Since Session Zero launched on April 17, the total value of crypto assets on the blockchain has surged $36 million to a record $195 million, and the amount of stablecoins deposited has risen by 8%, or around $3 million. Despite the gains, however, other metrics such as active addresses and transaction counts have fallen. Active addresses have declined by about 4%, and daily transactions have decreased by roughly 10%. This trend \u2014 rising asset values alongside falling user engagement \u2014 may be the result of high transaction fees. While users were initially eager to earn Scroll Marks, the prohibitively expensive fees may have deterred more activity. The much lower transaction fees may alter that pattern, although Scroll still remains the second-most expensive layer 2 network in terms of median transaction fees. It is still early, however, and fees may drop further as the network evolves. Dencun was a series of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important was EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the cost of transacting on layer 2 networks. EIP-4844 introduced blobs, which are a unique transaction format that segregates layer 2 network transactions from standard network activity on the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion and transaction fees. Scroll is the one of the last major Ethereum layer 2 blockchains to enable blobs since the Dencun upgrade went live on March 13. Scroll had been waiting for its Bernouli upgrade to go live. The two new features enabled by this upgrade are blobs, and SHA2-256, which is designed to improve security and efficiency for dapps on the blockchain. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Even 10 years after its collapse, Mt. Gox is still haunting the crypto market.\nAround $9.2 billion in Bitcoin could hit the market within the next six months in Mt. Gox repayments.\nWhile that\u2019s great news for creditors, the huge payouts threaten the crypto rally.\nBitcoin maxis could, however, soften the crash.",
                "body": " After a decade of waiting, creditors of collapsed Mt. Gox look one step closer to getting their lost $9.2 billion in investments back. That\u2019s great for them, but not so much for crypto investors. \u201dThis will weigh on the market once repatriation picks up in earnest or the market starts to pay more attention to it,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, a crypto hedge fund that has purchased Mt. Gox claims, told DL News that he had recently heard encouraging updates, a signal progress is underway. The defunct crypto exchange has almost 142,000 Bitcoin to give to creditors, a balance sheet from 2019 shows. Technically, that means almost $9.2 billion worth of Bitcoin could be sold anytime before October 31, Mt. Gox\u2019s final deadline for repayments. For comparison, the celebrated Bitcoin halving, which occurred on April 20, will reduce the amount of new Bitcoin hitting the market by roughly $5.3 billion over that same period of time. In other words, not only could the payout cancel out the supply dynamics of the halving, it could provide an additional $4 billion in selling pressure. However, Bitcoin maxis may save the market from crashing, crypto cognoscenti say. Details of the payout to Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors remain vague, making it hard to predict what impact it will have on Bitcoin\u2019s price. For starters, the repayment timing is uncertain. Repayments have been divided into three categories \u2014 base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. All of these have the same deadline, October 31, but they may not all be paid out at the same time. \u201cA mass Bitcoin redemption event is unlikely,\u201d Coinbase head of research David Duong told DL News. \u201cBut concerns around these repayments could still constrain liquidity as market players may avoid deploying new capital amid the uncertainty.\u201d \u201cThe market impact will likely depend on how the funds are returned,\u201d Rudick said. One of the firm\u2019s largest creditors, the Mt Gox Investment Fund, will receive its payout in a ratio of 70% Bitcoin and 30% cash, Bloomberg reported in 2023. But not everyone is concerned. Brad Howell, managing director of crypto market maker Keyrock UK, told DL News that the market could easily absorb the selling pressure. \u201cWhilst $9 billion worth of Bitcoin might sound like a large number we should put this into perspective,\u201d Howell said, pointing out that Bitcoin averaged $30 billion in daily trading volume in March. And the market processed $72 billion in trading volume when Bitcoin dropped 8% on March 19, Howell said. \u201cThis should give you an idea of the volume required to move a market of this size,\u201d he said. Howell said negativity about the impact of Mt. Gox on the market may just be sentiment. \u201cIt is fair to assume that anyone who had assets in Mt. Gox is an early adopter and more likely to lean towards the Bitcoin maxi end of the spectrum,\u201d Howell said, referring to diehard Bitcoin enthusiasts. \u201cDon\u2019t expect huge volumes to be dumped on day one.\u201d Dixon said Off The Chain Capital would be \u201cvery methodical\u201d about selling the Bitcoin it receives. The firm has $360 million in assets, and its Mt. Gox position makes up almost 20% of the fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking at other opportunities where we can get other crypto assets at a discount, because that\u2019ll help us outperform Bitcoin,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to try to sell all at once.\u201d After reaching an all-time high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin has slumped 14% over concerns about the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and tension in the Middle East. Launched in 2010 in Japan, Mt. Gox was one of the earliest crypto exchanges. At its peak, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide. The exchange abruptly suspended withdrawals and entered bankruptcy in 2014 following a series of hacks. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News. Got a tip about Mt. Gox and Bitcoin?

                "body": " Traders appear to be anticipating approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, after Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% on Monday. The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons. A decision from the regulator is expected to come on Thursday. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Europe is hoping its own blockchain will help it break free from dependence on US technology. On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Binance co-founder pleaded guilty to violating US banking law in November.\nHis successor is struggling to undo much of the model CZ built.\nThe judgment marks a dizzying fall for the crypto pioneer.",
                "body": " Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as \u201cCZ,\u201d was sentenced to four months in federal prison Tuesday for violating US banking laws. Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

                "keypoints": "Increased optimism that Ethereum spot ETFs will be approved is driving users back to Ethereum.\nTraders on Ethereum generated over $3.3 billion in volume on Monday, the highest since April 13.\nThe total value of assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached their highest levels since May 7, 2022.",
                "body": " Traders appear to be anticipating approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, after Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% on Monday. The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons. A decision from the regulator is expected to come on Thursday. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Europe is hoping its own blockchain will help it break free from dependence on US technology. On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun was exploited for nearly $2 million on Thursday.\nEarlier in the week, Pump.fun hit an all-time high in daily revenue of over $1.2 million.\nTrading on the platform is paused until further notice.",
                "body": " Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for memecoin launches, suffered an attack on Thursday, with an estimated $2 million in losses. The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun makes trading and launching memecoins easier and safer.\nIt generated over $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana.\nOver 83% of newly launched tokens on Solana Tuesday were from Pump.fun.",
                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Airdrop farmers who \u201csybiled\u201d LayerZero\u2019s airdrop must self-report.\nThose who don\u2019t risk losing their allocation.\nUser activity on LayerZero is down 50%.",
                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Under Zhao, Binance failed to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities, and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court papers. The sentence was a loss for prosecutors, who had requested a three-year sentence. \u201cEverything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature,\u201d US District Judge Richard Jones told Zhao at a federal courthouse in Seattle Tuesday morning, according to reporting from The Verge. Zhao\u2019s sentence comes one month after his former rival, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for a multibillion-dollar fraud. Hoping to avoid decades in prison, Bankman-Fried fought his charges in court, only to lose after a six-week trial. At his sentencing, the former billionaire was defiant, attributing FTX\u2019s failure and depositors\u2019 losses to mistakes and a series of unfortunate events rather than to top-down fraud \u2014 a fact cited by Judge Lewis Kaplan when he imposed a 25 year sentence, half of what prosecutors in that case had sought. In contrast, Zhao pled guilty and opened his own statement Tuesday by apologizing to the courtroom. \u201cI deeply regret my behavior and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he reportedly told the judge. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 But his sentence also marked a dramatic fall for a man who arrived late to the crypto scene but rapidly marshalled influence and liquidity in building a crypto exchange that still handles $14 billion in daily trading volume. He also made himself a billionaire. Zhao, 47, built the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange in part by telling staff to disregard US regulations that would have damped its breakneck growth, prosecutors wrote in a memo ahead of Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cBetter to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d Zhao told staff, according to prosecutors. Jones said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by that statement. \u2018Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature.\u2019 While Binance, and Zhao, still face a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sentence does mark the end of an era. Zhao, a China-born Canadian who earned a computer science degree at McGill University, founded the company in 2017. He took pride in a business model that broke from the bricks-and-mortar approach of traditional financial institutions. Binance has no headquarters and maintains employees in work-share spaces around the world. Under Zhao, the company also eschewed the routine practice of obtaining operating licences in the markets where it operated. That strategy is now backfiring and posing a serious challenge for Zhao\u2019s successor, Richard Teng. The byzantine, everywhere-but-nowhere business model drew the scrutiny of regulators. The SEC cited Binance\u2019s \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d in a separate lawsuit against the firm. That suit, which is still pending, could upend Binance\u2019s US operation if the exchange loses at trial. In November, Zhao struck a deal with prosecutors. He agreed to step down from his position as CEO, plead guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and pay a $50 million fine. \u2018I\u2019ve had a lot of quiet time alone to think and reflect.\u2019 Separately, Binance agreed to plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution. It was one of the largest payments the Justice Department has ever received from a corporation, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared together to announce details of the settlement on November 21. The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, was also present. The exchange\u2019s \u201cwillful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,\u201d Yellen said. US Attorney General Merrick Garland (centre) is flanked by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (left) and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco at a press conference on November 21. Photo by MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Binance also agreed to share information about its anti-money-laundering efforts with a court-appointed compliance monitor for five years. \u201cWhen Binance first launched, it did not have compliance controls adequate for the company that it was quickly becoming, and it should have,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told DL News in November. \u201cBinance made misguided decisions along the way. Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.\u201d Control passed to Teng, the company\u2019s former global head of regional markets. Before joining Binance in 2021, Teng was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and director of corporate finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Teng was considered a steady hand who could help the company address a growing regulatory onslaught and one day succeed Zhao. Binance\u2019s domination of the market has increased since Zhao\u2019s resignation. In November 2022, Binance accounted for about 40% of spot trading volume among centralised crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko. That figure has increased to 42% across spot and derivatives crypto markets, according to CCData. Nevertheless, Teng is facing a series of crises at the company. This year, a Nigerian investigation into market manipulation on the exchange spiraled into a standoff, with authorities arresting two executives who had come to the country to discuss officials\u2019 concerns. One executive, British national Nadeem Anjarwalla, made an audacious escape worthy of a Hollywood thriller when he slipped away from his guards and jetted out of the African nation using a second passport he had apparently concealed during his arrest. The other, former Internal Revenue Service agent Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody. His attorney in Nigeria has called his arrest \u201cstate-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u201d Another issue is brewing in the Philippines, where regulators have blocked access to the website. Apple and Google are working with regulators there to remove Binance from their mobile-phone app stores. The exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation. Amid the turmoil, Teng relented, and announced he would seek to establish a global headquarters. \u201cWe are speaking to a few jurisdictions, a few are under consideration,\u201d Teng said during an on-stage interview at the Paris Blockchain Week conference. In court Tuesday, prosecutors argued a three-year sentence reflected the severity of Zhao\u2019s crime. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a regulatory oops,\u201d prosecutor Kevin Mosley, said, according to the New York Times. \u201cBreaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.\u201d But the three-year recommendation was overboard, even going above the 12- to 18-month prison term recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, one of Zhao\u2019s attorneys, William Burck, said. Ultimately, the judge agreed. With reporting by Osato Avan-Namayo, Joanna Wright, and Callan Quinn. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. Have a tip?

                "keypoints": "The spot price ETFs spur hopes Chinese investors will get a route to invest in crypto.\nMany Hong Kong investors are keen to add the ETFs to their portfolios.\nHong Kong is the first Asian market to green-light the popular funds.",
                "body": " Hong Kong just joined the crypto ETF party. On Tuesday, three issuers listed six spot price Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the city. Yet unlike January, when US Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions of dollars in investment capital and sparked a record run for BTC, the Hong Kong versions are coming out amidst a deepening market lull. With worries mounting about high interest rates in the US and geopolitical risk in the Middle East, investors pulled $435 million from digital assets last week, the biggest outflow since March, according to CoinShares. In Hong Kong, the crypto ETFs received a rather muted reception, with total volume for the first day of trading hit $12 million, compared to $4.6 billion in the opening of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January. \u2018The enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism.\u2019 Still, money managers say there are signs local investors will flock to the new offerings. Almost 77% of investors polled recently told OSL, a Hong Kong digital assets firm, they intended to include spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in their investment portfolios. \u201cThe enthusiastic response from investors regarding both BTC and ETH ETFs reflects a deep-seated optimism about the potential of these products to enhance the financial landscape,\u201d Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, told DL News. But the big question is whether mainland Chinese will follow suit. Investors hope the new offerings will open a long desired route to Chinese investment capital. The three issuers are China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and Harvest Global, all of which were originally founded in mainland China. Given their links with China, expectations are running high that mainland investors may get access to Bitcoin and Ether. But when or if that happens \u2014 at least officially \u2014 is unclear. Crypto trading is banned in mainland China but remains popular. While it appears investors there will not be able to access the Hong Kong ETFs, executives from both Harvest Global and China Asset Management said in media interviews that the market may gradually open. Yimei Li, for instance, China Asset Management\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that she hoped Chinese investors will be able to participate in the future. She added that the launch opened the door for renminbi holders looking for alternative investments. Not everyone agrees. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said last week they thought official access to the ETFs remained very unlikely. Crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong are also not accessible to mainland investors. Still, Hong Kong investors appear to be keen on the new offerings. The spot ETFs will join Hong Kong\u2019s already existing virtual asset futures ETFs, which launched in late 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, the three futures ETFs had an average daily turnover of $6.6 million, up from $1.1 million a year earlier. The first quarter of 2024 saw net inflows of $68 million into the ETFs. Meanwhile, other Asian nations are weighing whether to permit investors to also access Bitcoin ETFs.

Since it runs on Solana\u2019s public blockchain network, Zeta offers the best of both worlds: the speed and user experience of a centralised exchange, and full self-custody and transparency for users. Zeta is one of the most-used, fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) perpetuals exchange on the market today. With Zeta, users enjoy: Decentralised perpetual contracts exchanges (perp DEX) registered an all-time high in monthly trading volume in March 2024 at $317 billion, representing 395% year-on-year growth, according to DefiLlama. Solana simultaneously witnessed its largest growth in derivatives trading volume, at 244%. Zeta is the major driving force behind this growth in the perp DEX sector, as its volume soared by 397% over the same period. GROWTH IN PERP DEX SECTOR (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez/Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) Last month, the company unveiled plans to release Solana\u2019s first L2 rollup. This month, even more details of future plans emerged when the company published the release schedule and planned incentives for $Z, its soon-to-be-launched governance token. The token generation event (TGE) will kick-start the following unlocks: An initial airdrop of 8% of the $Z supply distributed to traders, with loyalty boosts for early users. Initial stakers of $Z will qualify for an additional 2% airdrop, issued in the form of staked $Z 1 epoch (28 days) after the TGE. Traders will receive incentives comprising 30% of the total supply over 90 months, while 22.5% unlocked over 24 months will be committed to the Community Treasury to fund multi-year growth initiatives. These include liquidity provisioning, as well as Zeta\u2019s creator and ambassador programmes. Finally, the $Z token distribution airdrop will see 20% allocated to contributors and 17.5% to investors. Zeta\u2019s goal is to compete with central exchanges in speed, cost, user experience, and security, while providing the benefits of DeFi, that is, self-custody, accessibility, and the ability to co-own the protocol and participate in governance.

                "body": " Investor activity on zkSync is buzzing once again amid speculation that the blockchain\u2019s much-anticipated airdrop is imminent. DeFi users have deposited about $47 million into zkSync since Tuesday, DefiLlama data shows. By comparison, Polygon drew $8 million in flows during the same period, the second highest among all blockchains. ZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, hasn\u2019t seen this level of inflows since March when memecoin speculation reached a fever pitch. Speculation of a zkSync airdrop kicked into gear last week when Matter Labs, developers of the blockchain, announced the final network upgrade before it will hand the project\u2019s governance to the community by the end of June. DeFi-inclined users deduced that announcement to mean the release of zkSync\u2019s native token that will be used to govern the blockchain. Part of this token release event could also include an airdrop for early adopters \u2015 DeFi users who have conducted a transaction on zkSync. ZkSync competitors Optimism and Arbitrum also used a token launch and airdrop to begin their decentralised governance process. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t published any official literature on the airdrop, but reports emerged this week that it could happen on June 13. That would make June a big month for airdrops with investors also expecting airdrops from DeFi protocol LayerZero and blockchain network Blast. The Block reported that zkSync\u2019s token generation will happen this month with a supply count of 21 billion tokens. Splitting a project\u2019s token generation event and the actual airdrop is uncommon in crypto. But Ether restaking protocol EigenLayer chose that method with the tokens locked to prevent a price dump that often happens immediately after airdrops. ZkSync, along with LayerZero, has been among the most anticipated crypto airdrops, and both have attracted significant farming activity and fears of possible sybil activity. Farming means completing transactions on DeFi protocols or blockchains to become eligible for possible airdrops. Sybil farming takes that up several notches by deploying a cluster of wallet addresses to game the process and ensure a greater-than-average share of the token distribution. LayerZero has already advised mercenary airdrop hunters to self-report or lose their token allocation. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t publicly stated its anti-sybil protocols, if any. The developers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons.

On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Daily active users and total transactions on Arbitrum reached new highs on Monday.\nYet Arbitrum\u2019s governance token is down 58% from its all-time high earlier in the year.\nArbitrum is still the top Ethereum layer 2 blockchain by total value of crypto assets, daily transactions, and daily active users.",
                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "keypoints": "Public ledgers can\u2019t be sued if a transfer goes wrong, says Onyx CEO Umar Farooq.\nThe Bank for International Settlements advocates for regulated so-called unified ledgers as a global solution.\nCircle\u2019s global policy chief Dante Disparte says unified ledgers could be a national security threat.",
                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Since it runs on Solana\u2019s public blockchain network, Zeta offers the best of both worlds: the speed and user experience of a centralised exchange, and full self-custody and transparency for users. Zeta is one of the most-used, fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) perpetuals exchange on the market today. With Zeta, users enjoy: Decentralised perpetual contracts exchanges (perp DEX) registered an all-time high in monthly trading volume in March 2024 at $317 billion, representing 395% year-on-year growth, according to DefiLlama. Solana simultaneously witnessed its largest growth in derivatives trading volume, at 244%. Zeta is the major driving force behind this growth in the perp DEX sector, as its volume soared by 397% over the same period. GROWTH IN PERP DEX SECTOR (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez/Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) Last month, the company unveiled plans to release Solana\u2019s first L2 rollup. This month, even more details of future plans emerged when the company published the release schedule and planned incentives for $Z, its soon-to-be-launched governance token. The token generation event (TGE) will kick-start the following unlocks: An initial airdrop of 8% of the $Z supply distributed to traders, with loyalty boosts for early users. Initial stakers of $Z will qualify for an additional 2% airdrop, issued in the form of staked $Z 1 epoch (28 days) after the TGE. Traders will receive incentives comprising 30% of the total supply over 90 months, while 22.5% unlocked over 24 months will be committed to the Community Treasury to fund multi-year growth initiatives. These include liquidity provisioning, as well as Zeta\u2019s creator and ambassador programmes. Finally, the $Z token distribution airdrop will see 20% allocated to contributors and 17.5% to investors. Zeta\u2019s goal is to compete with central exchanges in speed, cost, user experience, and security, while providing the benefits of DeFi, that is, self-custody, accessibility, and the ability to co-own the protocol and participate in governance.

More Z-Score, more $Z. Users can earn more with Z-Score multipliers, for example, a 10% boost if they use a referral link. Users also earn 10% of referred fees, and 10% of referred Z-Score on a lifetime basis for all referrals. In the last two months alone, users on Zeta referred more than $1bn of trading volume. The company also recently announced it has raised a $5m strategic round, bringing total funding to $13.5m to-date. The round was led by Electric Capital, with participation from DACM, Airtree, and prominent angel investors such as Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana and Mert Mumtaz of Helius. Wintermute, Jump Crypto and Solana Ventures are investors in previous rounds. To date, Zeta has processed over 6.5m trades and $7.5bn in volume, with more than 100,000 monthly users.

                "body": " Investor activity on zkSync is buzzing once again amid speculation that the blockchain\u2019s much-anticipated airdrop is imminent. DeFi users have deposited about $47 million into zkSync since Tuesday, DefiLlama data shows. By comparison, Polygon drew $8 million in flows during the same period, the second highest among all blockchains. ZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, hasn\u2019t seen this level of inflows since March when memecoin speculation reached a fever pitch. Speculation of a zkSync airdrop kicked into gear last week when Matter Labs, developers of the blockchain, announced the final network upgrade before it will hand the project\u2019s governance to the community by the end of June. DeFi-inclined users deduced that announcement to mean the release of zkSync\u2019s native token that will be used to govern the blockchain. Part of this token release event could also include an airdrop for early adopters \u2015 DeFi users who have conducted a transaction on zkSync. ZkSync competitors Optimism and Arbitrum also used a token launch and airdrop to begin their decentralised governance process. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t published any official literature on the airdrop, but reports emerged this week that it could happen on June 13. That would make June a big month for airdrops with investors also expecting airdrops from DeFi protocol LayerZero and blockchain network Blast. The Block reported that zkSync\u2019s token generation will happen this month with a supply count of 21 billion tokens. Splitting a project\u2019s token generation event and the actual airdrop is uncommon in crypto. But Ether restaking protocol EigenLayer chose that method with the tokens locked to prevent a price dump that often happens immediately after airdrops. ZkSync, along with LayerZero, has been among the most anticipated crypto airdrops, and both have attracted significant farming activity and fears of possible sybil activity. Farming means completing transactions on DeFi protocols or blockchains to become eligible for possible airdrops. Sybil farming takes that up several notches by deploying a cluster of wallet addresses to game the process and ensure a greater-than-average share of the token distribution. LayerZero has already advised mercenary airdrop hunters to self-report or lose their token allocation. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t publicly stated its anti-sybil protocols, if any. The developers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons.

On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker.

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun makes trading and launching memecoins easier and safer.\nIt generated over $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana.\nOver 83% of newly launched tokens on Solana Tuesday were from Pump.fun.",
                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Daily active users and total transactions on Arbitrum reached new highs on Monday.\nYet Arbitrum\u2019s governance token is down 58% from its all-time high earlier in the year.\nArbitrum is still the top Ethereum layer 2 blockchain by total value of crypto assets, daily transactions, and daily active users.",
                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "OKX and seven other exchanges just said so long to Hong Kong \u2014 here\u2019s what that means for its crypto scene",
                "keypoints": "Abrupt departure of Hong Kong exchanges underscores challenges of getting licenced.\nThe development raises fresh questions about the city's plan to be a crypto hub.\nBut the exodus may be good news.",
                "body": " A couple of days after my arrival in Hong Kong last June, I attended my first crypto event. It did not disappoint. The party organised by OKX and the Hong Kong fan club for Manchester City, the top English football team and a corporate partner of the cryptocurrency exchange, was buzzing. The room thronged with people in sky blue Erling Haaland shirts who oscillated between free food and drinks and half-listened to presentations from OKX executives. OKX was clearly looking forward to a bright future in the rejuvenated Hong Kong market as it prepared to apply for its virtual asset trading platform licence. Not long after the party, OKX managing director Lennix Lai told me how excited he was to cement the firm into the city where it maintained its base of operations. Then last week, OKX abruptly withdrew its application for the Securities and Futures Commission licence. It gave its reason as \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of its business strategy, while assuring Hong Kong users that their funds were safe. It will cease trading services by Friday. At first glance, the departure of OKX would appear to be a blow for Hong Kong\u2019s aspirations to become Asia\u2019s go-to crypto hub. With daily trading volume of $3 billion, the centralised exchange is the fourth ranked platform worldwide, according to CoinMarketCap. Moreover, OKX is just one of seven companies that have withdrawn licensing applications since the deadline passed at the end of February. Like OKX, all these firms \u2014 and any others serving Hong Kong clients that have not applied for a licence \u2014 will need to wind down their services to city residents by May 31. In addition to OKX, subsidiaries of other international exchanges have withdrawn from Hong Kong in recent weeks, including Gate.io and HTX, formerly known as Huobi. HKVAEX, which the SCMP reported in October last year was backed by Binance, also withdrew its application. Yet the departure of these firms may signal progress in regulators\u2019 efforts to clean up Hong Kong\u2019s freewheeling crypto scene. Last year, Lai told me that getting the licence wasn\u2019t an easy process. Finding qualified people to conduct the required audits could be challenging. OKX also had to invest heavily in hiring talent, innovation, technology, compliance and system security to prepare for the application. (A report from CoinDesk estimated the cost of applying for a licence was between $12 million and $20 million.) The thing is, getting a licence is supposed to be hard. That\u2019s the point. Given the level of fraud in Hong Kong\u2019s crypto markets, the SFC wants crypto exchanges to comply with rigorous rules. The number of companies withdrawing applications isn\u2019t necessarily unusual. When Singapore introduced licensing for cryptocurrency service providers in January 2021, over 100 of the 170 applicants withdrew or were rejected by the end of the year, according to Nikkei Asia. In the UK, 71% of applications to the Financial Conduct Authority have also been withdrawn. Angela Ang, a senior policy advisor at TRM Labs, told DL News it seems the trend in Hong Kong is par for the course. \u201cThis could be a combination of higher regulatory expectations in wake of events like FTX, as well as the crypto industry being relatively new to regulation,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, licence applications aren\u2019t a trivial endeavour and require a significant amount of time and money. \u201cNobody will pull out lightly after investing all that time and resources,\u201d Ang added. \u201cThose that pulled out probably did so only after it was clear that they would otherwise have their applications rejected.\u201d The timing of the withdrawals just ahead of the cut off date for shutting down may also be an effort by the SFC to weed out those that don\u2019t make the cut for the deeming arrangement that will allow them to continue operating past June 1. \u201cIt sends a very clear signal about the type of crypto hub Hong Kong wants to be: strict,\u201d Ang said.

Since it runs on Solana\u2019s public blockchain network, Zeta offers the best of both worlds: the speed and user experience of a centralised exchange, and full self-custody and transparency for users. Zeta is one of the most-used, fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) perpetuals exchange on the market today. With Zeta, users enjoy: Decentralised perpetual contracts exchanges (perp DEX) registered an all-time high in monthly trading volume in March 2024 at $317 billion, representing 395% year-on-year growth, according to DefiLlama. Solana simultaneously witnessed its largest growth in derivatives trading volume, at 244%. Zeta is the major driving force behind this growth in the perp DEX sector, as its volume soared by 397% over the same period. GROWTH IN PERP DEX SECTOR (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez/Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) Last month, the company unveiled plans to release Solana\u2019s first L2 rollup. This month, even more details of future plans emerged when the company published the release schedule and planned incentives for $Z, its soon-to-be-launched governance token. The token generation event (TGE) will kick-start the following unlocks: An initial airdrop of 8% of the $Z supply distributed to traders, with loyalty boosts for early users. Initial stakers of $Z will qualify for an additional 2% airdrop, issued in the form of staked $Z 1 epoch (28 days) after the TGE. Traders will receive incentives comprising 30% of the total supply over 90 months, while 22.5% unlocked over 24 months will be committed to the Community Treasury to fund multi-year growth initiatives. These include liquidity provisioning, as well as Zeta\u2019s creator and ambassador programmes. Finally, the $Z token distribution airdrop will see 20% allocated to contributors and 17.5% to investors. Zeta\u2019s goal is to compete with central exchanges in speed, cost, user experience, and security, while providing the benefits of DeFi, that is, self-custody, accessibility, and the ability to co-own the protocol and participate in governance.

                "body": " Investor activity on zkSync is buzzing once again amid speculation that the blockchain\u2019s much-anticipated airdrop is imminent. DeFi users have deposited about $47 million into zkSync since Tuesday, DefiLlama data shows. By comparison, Polygon drew $8 million in flows during the same period, the second highest among all blockchains. ZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, hasn\u2019t seen this level of inflows since March when memecoin speculation reached a fever pitch. Speculation of a zkSync airdrop kicked into gear last week when Matter Labs, developers of the blockchain, announced the final network upgrade before it will hand the project\u2019s governance to the community by the end of June. DeFi-inclined users deduced that announcement to mean the release of zkSync\u2019s native token that will be used to govern the blockchain. Part of this token release event could also include an airdrop for early adopters \u2015 DeFi users who have conducted a transaction on zkSync. ZkSync competitors Optimism and Arbitrum also used a token launch and airdrop to begin their decentralised governance process. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t published any official literature on the airdrop, but reports emerged this week that it could happen on June 13. That would make June a big month for airdrops with investors also expecting airdrops from DeFi protocol LayerZero and blockchain network Blast. The Block reported that zkSync\u2019s token generation will happen this month with a supply count of 21 billion tokens. Splitting a project\u2019s token generation event and the actual airdrop is uncommon in crypto. But Ether restaking protocol EigenLayer chose that method with the tokens locked to prevent a price dump that often happens immediately after airdrops. ZkSync, along with LayerZero, has been among the most anticipated crypto airdrops, and both have attracted significant farming activity and fears of possible sybil activity. Farming means completing transactions on DeFi protocols or blockchains to become eligible for possible airdrops. Sybil farming takes that up several notches by deploying a cluster of wallet addresses to game the process and ensure a greater-than-average share of the token distribution. LayerZero has already advised mercenary airdrop hunters to self-report or lose their token allocation. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t publicly stated its anti-sybil protocols, if any. The developers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Traders appear to be anticipating approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, after Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% on Monday. The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons.

                "body": " Europe is hoping its own blockchain will help it break free from dependence on US technology. On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

                "body": " Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for memecoin launches, suffered an attack on Thursday, with an estimated $2 million in losses. The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " LayerZero has instructed sybil airdrop farmers to self-report by handing over their addresses to the team or risk receiving nothing from its planned token airdrop. Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.

                "headline": "OKX and seven other exchanges just said so long to Hong Kong \u2014 here\u2019s what that means for its crypto scene",
                "keypoints": "Abrupt departure of Hong Kong exchanges underscores challenges of getting licenced.\nThe development raises fresh questions about the city's plan to be a crypto hub.\nBut the exodus may be good news.",
                "body": " A couple of days after my arrival in Hong Kong last June, I attended my first crypto event. It did not disappoint. The party organised by OKX and the Hong Kong fan club for Manchester City, the top English football team and a corporate partner of the cryptocurrency exchange, was buzzing. The room thronged with people in sky blue Erling Haaland shirts who oscillated between free food and drinks and half-listened to presentations from OKX executives. OKX was clearly looking forward to a bright future in the rejuvenated Hong Kong market as it prepared to apply for its virtual asset trading platform licence. Not long after the party, OKX managing director Lennix Lai told me how excited he was to cement the firm into the city where it maintained its base of operations. Then last week, OKX abruptly withdrew its application for the Securities and Futures Commission licence. It gave its reason as \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of its business strategy, while assuring Hong Kong users that their funds were safe. It will cease trading services by Friday. At first glance, the departure of OKX would appear to be a blow for Hong Kong\u2019s aspirations to become Asia\u2019s go-to crypto hub. With daily trading volume of $3 billion, the centralised exchange is the fourth ranked platform worldwide, according to CoinMarketCap. Moreover, OKX is just one of seven companies that have withdrawn licensing applications since the deadline passed at the end of February. Like OKX, all these firms \u2014 and any others serving Hong Kong clients that have not applied for a licence \u2014 will need to wind down their services to city residents by May 31. In addition to OKX, subsidiaries of other international exchanges have withdrawn from Hong Kong in recent weeks, including Gate.io and HTX, formerly known as Huobi. HKVAEX, which the SCMP reported in October last year was backed by Binance, also withdrew its application. Yet the departure of these firms may signal progress in regulators\u2019 efforts to clean up Hong Kong\u2019s freewheeling crypto scene. Last year, Lai told me that getting the licence wasn\u2019t an easy process. Finding qualified people to conduct the required audits could be challenging. OKX also had to invest heavily in hiring talent, innovation, technology, compliance and system security to prepare for the application. (A report from CoinDesk estimated the cost of applying for a licence was between $12 million and $20 million.) The thing is, getting a licence is supposed to be hard. That\u2019s the point. Given the level of fraud in Hong Kong\u2019s crypto markets, the SFC wants crypto exchanges to comply with rigorous rules. The number of companies withdrawing applications isn\u2019t necessarily unusual. When Singapore introduced licensing for cryptocurrency service providers in January 2021, over 100 of the 170 applicants withdrew or were rejected by the end of the year, according to Nikkei Asia. In the UK, 71% of applications to the Financial Conduct Authority have also been withdrawn. Angela Ang, a senior policy advisor at TRM Labs, told DL News it seems the trend in Hong Kong is par for the course. \u201cThis could be a combination of higher regulatory expectations in wake of events like FTX, as well as the crypto industry being relatively new to regulation,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, licence applications aren\u2019t a trivial endeavour and require a significant amount of time and money. \u201cNobody will pull out lightly after investing all that time and resources,\u201d Ang added. \u201cThose that pulled out probably did so only after it was clear that they would otherwise have their applications rejected.\u201d The timing of the withdrawals just ahead of the cut off date for shutting down may also be an effort by the SFC to weed out those that don\u2019t make the cut for the deeming arrangement that will allow them to continue operating past June 1. \u201cIt sends a very clear signal about the type of crypto hub Hong Kong wants to be: strict,\u201d Ang said.

Zeta is one of the most-used, fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) perpetuals exchange on the market today. With Zeta, users enjoy: Decentralised perpetual contracts exchanges (perp DEX) registered an all-time high in monthly trading volume in March 2024 at $317 billion, representing 395% year-on-year growth, according to DefiLlama. Solana simultaneously witnessed its largest growth in derivatives trading volume, at 244%.

GROWTH IN PERP DEX SECTOR (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez/Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) Last month, the company unveiled plans to release Solana\u2019s first L2 rollup. This month, even more details of future plans emerged when the company published the release schedule and planned incentives for $Z, its soon-to-be-launched governance token. The token generation event (TGE) will kick-start the following unlocks: An initial airdrop of 8% of the $Z supply distributed to traders, with loyalty boosts for early users. Initial stakers of $Z will qualify for an additional 2% airdrop, issued in the form of staked $Z 1 epoch (28 days) after the TGE. Traders will receive incentives comprising 30% of the total supply over 90 months, while 22.5% unlocked over 24 months will be committed to the Community Treasury to fund multi-year growth initiatives. These include liquidity provisioning, as well as Zeta\u2019s creator and ambassador programmes. Finally, the $Z token distribution airdrop will see 20% allocated to contributors and 17.5% to investors. Zeta\u2019s goal is to compete with central exchanges in speed, cost, user experience, and security, while providing the benefits of DeFi, that is, self-custody, accessibility, and the ability to co-own the protocol and participate in governance.

                "body": " Investor activity on zkSync is buzzing once again amid speculation that the blockchain\u2019s much-anticipated airdrop is imminent. DeFi users have deposited about $47 million into zkSync since Tuesday, DefiLlama data shows. By comparison, Polygon drew $8 million in flows during the same period, the second highest among all blockchains. ZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, hasn\u2019t seen this level of inflows since March when memecoin speculation reached a fever pitch. Speculation of a zkSync airdrop kicked into gear last week when Matter Labs, developers of the blockchain, announced the final network upgrade before it will hand the project\u2019s governance to the community by the end of June. DeFi-inclined users deduced that announcement to mean the release of zkSync\u2019s native token that will be used to govern the blockchain. Part of this token release event could also include an airdrop for early adopters \u2015 DeFi users who have conducted a transaction on zkSync. ZkSync competitors Optimism and Arbitrum also used a token launch and airdrop to begin their decentralised governance process. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t published any official literature on the airdrop, but reports emerged this week that it could happen on June 13. That would make June a big month for airdrops with investors also expecting airdrops from DeFi protocol LayerZero and blockchain network Blast. The Block reported that zkSync\u2019s token generation will happen this month with a supply count of 21 billion tokens. Splitting a project\u2019s token generation event and the actual airdrop is uncommon in crypto. But Ether restaking protocol EigenLayer chose that method with the tokens locked to prevent a price dump that often happens immediately after airdrops. ZkSync, along with LayerZero, has been among the most anticipated crypto airdrops, and both have attracted significant farming activity and fears of possible sybil activity. Farming means completing transactions on DeFi protocols or blockchains to become eligible for possible airdrops. Sybil farming takes that up several notches by deploying a cluster of wallet addresses to game the process and ensure a greater-than-average share of the token distribution. LayerZero has already advised mercenary airdrop hunters to self-report or lose their token allocation. Matter Labs hasn\u2019t publicly stated its anti-sybil protocols, if any.

                "headline": "Ethereum ETF optimism sends DeFi metrics soaring",
                "keypoints": "Increased optimism that Ethereum spot ETFs will be approved is driving users back to Ethereum.\nTraders on Ethereum generated over $3.3 billion in volume on Monday, the highest since April 13.\nThe total value of assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached their highest levels since May 7, 2022.",
                "body": " Traders appear to be anticipating approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, after Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% on Monday. The optimism has fueled a surge in activity on the Ethereum network as Ethereum trading volume skyrocketed to over $3.3 billion on Monday, the highest level since April 13 and a 157% increase from the day before. Uniswap, the leading decentralised exchange on Ethereum by trading volume and total value of crypto assets deposited, saw its volume double on Monday from Sunday to $2.3 billion. Daily trading volume on Ethereum's decentralised exchanges (DefiLlama) Similarly, on Curve Finance, the second-largest decentralised exchange, volume doubled to $576 million on Monday from the day before. On Lido, a liquid staking platform, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, the total value of crypto assets deposited rose by 21.6% and 22.7% respectively. Increases or decreases in total value locked, or TVL, generally track the price of Ether, because a big portion of the TVL in Ethereum-based staking and restaking protocols is composed of Ether. Thus, as Ether\u2019s price rises, the dollar value of the assets locked in these protocols increases. However, looking at new inflows and outflows, Lido saw about $116 million worth of Ether exit the protocol, while EigenLayer benefited from $37 million in new deposits. Overall, the total value of crypto assets deposited in Ethereum protocols reached $64.7 billion on Monday, its highest level since May 7, 2022. Looking at volumes generated by bots on the messaging app Telegram, a rough proxy for memecoin trading, Ethereum marked its highest volume day since April 24 on Monday, generating $26.5 million in volume. The average transaction fee on Ethereum, which hit its lowest level of the year at $1.70 on Saturday, spiked to $6.69 on Monday, marking a threefold increase. Further underscoring the excitement around the Ethereum ecosystem, seven out of the top 10 protocols by revenue generated are predominately based on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. Ethereum saw its largest daily USD increase on Monday, jumping $585. The momentum extended into Tuesday, with Ethereum recently up 3.2% to $3,777. Adding to this optimistic outlook, the SEC indicated on Tuesday that it is leaning toward approving spot Ether ETFs, according to a report from Barrons. A decision from the regulator is expected to come on Thursday. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Europe is hoping its own blockchain will help it break free from dependence on US technology. On Tuesday, the European Union set up a new organisation designed to introduce blockchain infrastructure and revamp record keeping and the transfer of data transfer between the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. The launch took place during a meeting of telecommunications ministers at the European Council in Brussels. Lawmakers also rubber stamped the EU\u2019s landmark law on artificial intelligence. \u2018Europeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens.\u2019 The blockchain infrastructure will impact both individuals and companies, said Mathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation. Michel, who pushed for the blockchain project administered by EU states, has dubbed it Europeum. \u201cEuropeum will have a tangible presence in the daily lives of European citizens,\u201d he said at a press conference. It would allow citizens to trace the origins of their products, and enable businesses to protect their intellectual property by maintaining data on immutable blockchain networks, he said. Ten European member states, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, have agreed to help operate and roll out the EU blockchain. Other European countries will still be able to use the blockchain infrastructure. More nations are expected to join, Michel said. Germany and France have not committed to the arrangement. Still, the latter has been supportive of the project, Michel told DL News earlier. \u201cWe need to create a new sovereign infrastructure, rather than depending on Amazon Web Services for telecom,\u201d Michel told DL News at an event earlier in May, alluding to the online retailer\u2019s global cloud computing business. The idea is that digital identities, wallets, credentials and licences will be recorded on Europeum. Michel hopes the blockchain infrastructure will translate legal and bureaucratic processes into efficiently automated smart contracts. And that it will support metaverse applications, as well as the European Central Bank\u2019s digital euro. \u201cWe speak about the future of digital twins or the metaverse, so we need to have a sovereign infrastructure that can meet important criteria such as singularity, security, privacy, interoperability.\u201d The blockchain infrastructure has been under construction since 2017. Under the auspices of an agency called the European Blockchain and Services Infrastructure. Developers and companies created a prototype which already functions today, European Commission officials have told DL News. Since the European Commission does not have legal basis to operate a blockchain for European citizens to use, it has remained in pilot mode. That\u2019s why the project is now transformed into a so-called European Digital Infrastructure Consortium, a multinational project supported by the European Commission. These consortia come under Europe\u2019s Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, a project sitting on \u20ac165 billion to support its objectives. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to be happy that Europeum exists,\u201d Michel said during the interview. \u201cThey just need to know that if the data is exchanged between nations, administration or companies, it is safe to use.\u201d Inbar Preiss is DL News\u2019 Brussels correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun was exploited for nearly $2 million on Thursday.\nEarlier in the week, Pump.fun hit an all-time high in daily revenue of over $1.2 million.\nTrading on the platform is paused until further notice.",
                "body": " Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for memecoin launches, suffered an attack on Thursday, with an estimated $2 million in losses. The attack comes just two days after the platform hit an all-time high in daily revenue generated of over $1.2 million on Tuesday. The platform, which lets developers easily launch tokens in just a few steps, saw its contracts compromised and paused trading to prevent further damage. \u201cWe are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,\u201d Pump.fun said on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve paused trading \u2014 you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins currently migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not migrate for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Once tokens hit a market cap of $69,000, they can be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on Solana. A bonding curve refers to how a token\u2019s price increase when its supply decreases and vice versa. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute who analysed the attack, suggested that the private key was compromised. The attacker used flash loans to trick the platform\u2019s bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens, making the tokens appear valuable despite no traders buying organically. An account on X, known as Stacc, appeared to take credit for the attack, posting, \u201cI\u2019m about to change the course of history\u201d and went on to post \u201cDo not care, I am already fully doxxed.\u201d Stacc hinted that the stolen funds would\u2019nt be kept but rather transferred to some token users, although his initial estimates of $80 million seem to now be closer to $2 million as mentioned by Igamberdiev. DL News couldn\u2019t independently confirm Stacc\u2019s claims, and the Pump.fun team hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the attacker\u2019s identity. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and it\u2019s not evident how Stacc executed the exploit or if they distributed the balances to random people, although some have claimed to receive SOL from the exploiter. Pump.fun advertises itself as a \u201cfair launch\u201d platform. It allows users to mint new tokens for a few dollars, with its revenue coming from fees it charges when users buy and sell these tokens. The attack caused significant losses, but didn\u2019t result in a substantial profit for the attacker. Despite the chaos, assets still in the protocol are currently safe, according to Pump.fun\u2019s team. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Pump.fun makes trading and launching memecoins easier and safer.\nIt generated over $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana.\nOver 83% of newly launched tokens on Solana Tuesday were from Pump.fun.",
                "body": " Make it easy, and users will come. That could be the theme for Pump.fun, a protocol that attempts to make trading and creating memecoins simple and safe. The platform generated $1.2 million in revenue on Monday, surpassing Solana\u2019s $730,000 and becoming the third-highest revenue-generating project on that day, according to data from DefiLlama. While it operates on both the Solana and Blast blockchains, most of its success comes from Solana. Pump.fun makes it easy for users to launch new memecoins, and it ensures a secure trading environment where traders don\u2019t have to worry about outright scams. Pump.fun has surged in popularity over the past year with the increase in memecoin trading. Daily tokens deployed through Pump.fun (Dune: Hashed Official) More than 550,000 tokens have been launched on the platform, reaching an all-time high on Monday with 19,261 tokens deployed and generating 8,347 SOL, or around $1.2 million, in revenue. The number of tokens deployed represents the majority on Solana. For example, on Tuesday, 22,664 new tokens were launched on Solana, and Pump.fun was responsible for 18,853 of them \u2014 about 83% of all tokens launched that day. To date, Pump.fun has generated 140,300 SOL in revenue, worth about $21.5 million at current prices. Pump.fun doesn\u2019t have its own native token and hasn\u2019t announced any plans to launch one, so all of its revenue goes directly to its team. The platform produces revenue through a 1% fee on trades and a two SOL fee when coins reach enough liquidity to be listed on Raydium, a decentralised exchange on the Solana blockchain. The main selling point of Pump.fun is its commitment to fair launches, ensuring that all tokens on the site have no presales or team allocations. That setup prevents rug pulls \u2014 a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run off with investors\u2019 funds \u2014 providing traders with a secure and trustworthy environment. For traders, the process begins by visiting the official Pump.fun site and selecting a memecoin that catches their interest. Initially, trading is exclusive to Pump.fun, with the coin\u2019s price following a bonding curve based on demand, meaning the price increases as more users purchase the coin. Once a token\u2019s market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is added to Raydium and subsequently burned, ensuring the token\u2019s stability and value. On the Blast blockchain, trading remains on Pump.fun until the market cap reaches $420,000, at which point $30,000 of liquidity is added to the Thruster decentralised exchange and burned, allowing for broader trading opportunities. This creates a system where traders can know what to expect, as each coin follows the same rules. For users who wish to deploy a token on Pump.fun, the process is simple. All a user has to do is pick a name, ticker, and JPG image for the token. They can then instantly deploy the token on Pump.fun and anyone will be able to trade it. Still, coins launched through Pump.fun don\u2019t guarantee success. A majority of the memecoins launched through Pump.fun \u2014 and any other venue for that matter \u2014 lose most, if not all, of their value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " As transaction fees hit their lowest level on Ethereum in years, Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, reached an all-time high in activity. The daily number of active addresses on Arbitrum soared to an all-time high of 856,000 on Monday, up 150% from the 341,000 recorded at the start of May. This surge pushed Arbitrum past Solana\u2019s 833,000 daily active users, despite the recent popularity on Solana driven by the memecoin trading frenzy. This comes as Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on March 15, lowering the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains by as much as 99%. Daily active addresses and transaction count on Arbitrum (Growthepie) A week prior to the upgrade, the number of transactions on Arbitrum was only 747,000, and a week after that, the number jumped to 1.5 million, before hitting the high on Monday. The Arbitrum DAO also recently made public its plans to invest 35 million ARB tokens in stable, liquid assets. This resulted in more than two dozen companies pitching potential products, including heavyweights Franklin Templeton, the trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, the company helping BlackRock on its quest to tokenise assets. Despite these major developments, the total value of crypto assets on Arbitrum has declined 22% to $15.7 billion from an all-time high of $20 billion on April 1. Trading volumes on Arbitrum\u2019s decentralised exchanges have fallen 82% to $404 million from a peak of $2.2 billion on March 4. The price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, hasn\u2019t fared well either. ARB hit an all-time high of $2.26 on January 11 and came close again on March 7, reaching $2.17. Since January, however, the token has declined by 58%, now trading at $0.94. In contrast, Ethereum has risen by about 10% during the same period. One reason for ARB\u2019s lagging price may be the large token unlock by Offchain Labs, the development team behind Arbitrum, and its investors. On March 15, about $1.2 billion worth of ARB tokens were unlocked and distributed to these groups. Those tokens were vested for one year. Still, Arbitrum is the preferred layer 2 blockchain by total bridged Ether. According to data as of April 28, just over 1.7 million Ether was transferred to Arbitrum, while Arbitrum\u2019s 14 largest layer 2 competitors saw only around 1.5 million Ether bridged to their blockchains.

                "keypoints": "EigenLayer\u2019s upcoming airdrop cuts out Americans.\nAave\u2019s v4 announcement ruffles feathers.\nDL News may have confirmed the real identity of ZKasino\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on May 7. Sign up here. GM, Aleks here filling in for my colleague Tim. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: DeFi projects are announcing token airdrops left and right in a bid to cash in on rising crypto prices. Just this past week, so-called SocialFi platform friend.tech handed out over 13 million FRIEND tokens to early users, netting some recipients six-figure airdrops. But the friend.tech airdrop will likely pale in comparison with the upcoming EIGEN airdrop, scheduled for May 11. Crypto deposited in friend.tech stood at $13 million on Monday. EigenLayer? More than $15 billion. Undoubtedly, a good portion of EigenLayer deposits came from users in the US. So American users were miffed to find out they would be barred from the upcoming airdrop because of their location in a \u201cjurisdiction otherwise considered high risk with respect to the airdrop.\u201d And, no, a VPN won\u2019t save them. Excluding Americans from airdrops isn\u2019t new. As far back as 2021, crypto perpetual futures exchange dYdX barred US users from its airdrop. But now airdrops are rarely retroactive. Many protocols have switched to running \u201cpoints\u201d campaigns to lure in more deposits. The result is airdrops that look more and more like yield farming. Many argue that EigenLayer shouldn\u2019t have accepted deposits from those in the US if it never planned to include them in the airdrop \u2014 it\u2019s like a bank advertising a lucrative interest rate then refusing to pay it out to depositors. And EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only multi-billion dollar DeFi protocol gearing up for an airdrop. Cross-chain bridge LayerZero has also shared similar plans. LayerZero and its related crypto bridge Stargate have no problem letting US send crypto or provide liquidity for bridge transactions. Airdrop hopefuls are now watching closely to see if LayerZero will also bar US users. I find comfort in the steady rhythm of a ticking clock, the bounce of a basketball, and a crypto founder complaining that a competitor stole their code. For our past coverage on crypto\u2019s open-source conundrum, see here and here and here. A refresher: Open-source development is sacrosanct in crypto. The OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is open-source. Folks are free to use the code as they please. After all, folks in the industry are trying to build a more open and transparent financial system. Might as well let everyone take a peek at what\u2019s happening under the hood. Here\u2019s the problem: Good ideas spread rapidly, but often at the expense of the people who cooked them up in the first place. IP? Copyright? Fugheddaboutit. The latest kerfuffle came last week, when Aave Labs announced \u201cAave 2030,\u201d an ambitious set of proposals that include a rebrand and a new version of the company\u2019s eponymous lending-and-borrowing protocol, dubbed \u201cV4.\u201d Within hours, competitors voiced their displeasure. Curve founder Michael Egorov told DL News he spoke with Aave founder Stani Kulechov, and they\u2019re simpatico. \u201c[Aave] likely won\u2019t copy the algo. They are fascinated by the feature, but would implement [it] on their own. That is fine in this case,\u201d Egorov said. \u201cBut also not an insignificant thing to build! That\u2019s like building a rocket. Building your own to go to space is a good thing. \u2026 Going to space is not a \u2018concept\u2019 you can steal.\u201d Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol. Last month, ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, disappeared $30 million in user deposits, exchanging users\u2019 deposited Ether for a protocol-issued token, ZKAS. The switch brought on a huge outcry as depositors were unable to redeem their Ether. New documents shed light on the identity of one of its pseudonymous founders, Derivatives Monke. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said. It isn\u2019t clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. But legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. Other evidence, including pictures on social media, company registration documents, and a scan of a passport shared with DL News, suggests Nourzai and Derivatives Monke are one and the same. Nourzai, who has lashed out at previous accusations on social media, didn\u2019t respond to a DL News request for comment. ZKasino investors are now focused on getting their crypto back. Previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. But Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. We\u2019re keeping an eye on friend.tech activity, to see whether last week\u2019s airdrop can revive interest in the struggling protocol. Friend.tech enjoyed a post-airdrop bump \u2014 the question is, will it last?

                "body": " Public ledgers, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, are \u201cnot fit\u201d for large transactions. That\u2019s according to Umar Farooq, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s asset-tokenisation platform Onyx. \u201cWhat if something goes wrong? Who do I sue?\u201d Farooq said at the Bank for International Settlements\u2019 Innovation Summit in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday. \u201cYou can trust in code all you want, but there\u2019s no code court.\u201d Ethereum and other public blockchains support millions of transactions per day. But the blockchains aren\u2019t secure enough for high-value transactions carried out between banks and financial institutions, Farooq said. \u201cYou need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,\u201d he said. The BIS advocates for a \u201cnew type of financial market infrastructure\u201d it calls a unified ledger to link between central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, digital assets, and tokenised bank deposits. The so-called unified ledgers that connect platforms from central banks and other large financial institutions are \u201calmost a necessity\u201d to handle transactions worth millions or billions of dollars, Farooq said. Farooq\u2019s concerns come as Wall Street giants pile onto crypto assets, governments race to issue CBDCs, and financial institutions vie for a stake in the growing tokenisation of financial assets in the hopes of revamping the financial system. Tokenisation refers to recording the right to an asset on a digital token on a blockchain. Onyx speeds up short-term lending transactions by using smart contracts to tokenise cash and collateral. And its coin, JPM Coin, reportedly handles about $1 billion daily. But without interoperability, the global ecosystem and its liquidity may be disjointed. Unified ledgers \u201cshould be the world\u2019s global layer for money movement,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cOtherwise, you just will always be \u2026 in silos.\u201d The concept is being developed by regulators and finance giants around the world to allow the exchange and settlement of tokenised central bank as well as commercial bank money on distributed ledgers. But unified ledgers and the like may not have accounted for hurdles that come to international relations and conflicts. \u201cThe unified ledger conversation almost entirely ignores geopolitics,\u201d Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer, Circle, said at the BIS\u2019 conference. \u201cYou don\u2019t weaponise a currency, you weaponise the rails on which currencies ride,\u201d he said. For instance, in 2022 the European Union imposed a ban on several Russian banks from the international banking payment network Swift in the wake of the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe geopolitical reality in cross-border payments integration of this kind is often a line too far for national security interests, and that\u2019s the unfortunate piece of the puzzle,\u201d Disparate said. Work on unified ledgers continues. Last month, the BIS Innovation Hub launched a project dubbed Agor\u00e1 that brings central banks together to integrate the financial system by tokenising its own money so that it can settle payments on blockchains. The Bank of Korea said it would test a wholesale CBDC as a settlement asset for commercial bank tokenised deposits with the BIS. Outside the BIS, finance leaders are developing other networks to create a ledger-based infrastructure that would enable quick cross-border payments and trading of tokenised assets. An initiative called Global Layer One develops this goal with Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan among others. And the Regulated Liability Network, made up of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, HSBC, and others, is working to provide immediate, onchain settlements. Inbar Preiss is regulation correspondent at DL News.

Airdrop hunters who self-report their sybil activity by May 17 will suffer an 85% haircut on their token allocation and be allowed to claim the rest of their tokens, the project said in an X post on Friday. \u201cWe are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,\u201d LayerZero said. LayerZero also published a blog post detailing the sybil filtering methods it used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity. Some of the filtering parameters include minting so-called valueless NFTS and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity. Sybil activity is a major problem for crypto projects, especially when an airdrop is expected. Mercenary users adopt sybil tactics that include a cluster of several addresses to drum up activity on target protocols or blockchains to secure a greater share of the airdrop. As such, the user activity seen by project teams before announcing their airdrop often declines once the token distribution happens. Projects such as Solana-based real estate trading marketplace Parcl lost 67% of its investor deposits after its airdrop last month. A similar decline happened with the Starknet blockchain after its airdrop in February. The decline occurs because mercenary farmers move their funds to projects that have yet to distribute their tokens. User activity on LayerZero has fallen by more than 50% since the DeFi protocol announced its highly anticipated airdrop snapshot. LayerZero\u2019s daily activity was around 300,000 cross-chain transactions on April 30, the day before it announced the airdrop. That figure is now at about 150,000, data from the protocol\u2019s onchain explorer shows. LayerZero, a protocol that enables connections between otherwise incompatible blockchains, announced the first snapshot for its airdrop and said it would provide more information about the token distribution later. A snapshot shows the state of a blockchain at a particular time and can be used as a cut-off point to determine eligible recipients for an airdrop. Recently, crypto projects have begun to adopt a process of airdropping tokens in multiple distribution rounds to discourage the mass exit of users post-airdrop. Protocols such as decentralised exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen to airdrop tokens in more than one round. LayerZero might join this new wave as the team behind the protocol said the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop. That has led to speculation that there will be other snapshots in the future.

                "headline": "Angry investors say ZKasino stole $30m in crypto as Dutch police make arrest linked to scam",
                "keypoints": "Dutch authorities have arrested a 26-year-old man in connection with \"large-scale scam\" at ZKasino.\nZKasino sparked an outcry when it converted users Ether deposits into a new token of its own creation.\nLegal documents shed light on the main figure behind ZKasino, known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke.",
                "body": " An explosive Dutch arrest and asset seizure adds a new twist in a controversy over ZKasino, a crypto gambling platform, which vanished with some $30 million in user deposits last month. Angry investors say the Friday announcement that Dutch authorities made an arrest of a 26-year-old man linked to ZKasino means they\u2019re a step closer to getting their money back and getting justice. \u201cIt shows the system works and that these muppets cannot get away with it,\u201d a user posting under the name bingojack said via Telegram. A victims chat group was set up last month by those saying they lost money on ZKasino. Amid the drama, DL News may have confirmed the real identity of the pseudonymous founder of ZKasino along with raising questions about how the DeFi project got its funding. \u201cThe FIOD arrested a 26-year-old man who is suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering,\u201d FIOD Belastingdienst, a Dutch agency that combats financial fraud, said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation focuses on a large-scale scam surrounding the alleged gambling platform ZKasino,\u201d the agency said, adding that more than $30 million in crypto had been invested by victims. In addition to the arrest, Dutch authorities said they had seized \u20ac11.4 million worth of various assets, including real estate, a luxury car, and various cryptocurrencies. The agency did not respond to a DL News request for further comment. It is not clear who Dutch authorities arrested in connection with the missing millions. Legal documents viewed by DL News show Elham Nourzai, a 26-year-old Dutch national known online under the pseudonym Derivatives Monke, was the main figure behind ZKasino. A ZKasino investor who corresponded with Derivatives Monke before investing told DL News they received contracts signed by someone called Elham Nourzai. A scan of a passport shared with DL News belonging to someone called Elham Nourzai shows that he is a Dutch national. The date of birth on Nourzai\u2019s passport makes him 26 years old. A signature on ZigZag Capital Ltd\u2019s Register of Directors document seen by DL News matches the signature on Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport. Photos posted by Derivatives Monke of himself on X show someone who looks similar to Elham Nourzai\u2019s passport photo. On March 17, ZKasino and its founders announced a programme called Bridge-to-Earn, offering users a chance to lock up their Ether and earn rewards. But when it came time to redeem a month later, investors say ZKasino suddenly changed the rules. \u201cWe have made changes from our initial plan,\u201d the project on April 20 said. Users\u2019 Ether will now be swapped out for ZKAS \u2014 a new token that ZKasino created. \u201cThis conversion was done as a favour to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem.\u201d The switch brought on a huge outcry. Depositors were unable to redeem their Ether in full as advertised, meaning, in effect, ZKasino simply kept their funds. Onchain records show ZKasino has since converted users\u2019 Ether to Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether, so that ZKasino, not users, are earning staking rewards. ZKasino has not responded to the situation publicly, and did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. Defizard, a pseudonymous crypto trader, says he invested $24,000 on ZKasino. \u201cThere were really good conditions\u201d on the form for investors, he told DL News. The price per token offered to him was three times lower than the price that ZKasino planned to later sell tokens to the public for. Defizard bought ZKasino\u2019s ZKAS token privately before it launched at a favourable rate. He worries his investment is now worthless. Not everyone was convinced. BlackDragon, a decentralised fundraising group, had considered investing members\u2019 $250,000 in ZKasino, but decided against it. BlackDragon CEO Domagoj Zdilar said the ZKasino founders mocked him in text messages when he requested they reveal their identities before he invested. \u201cThe way these guys conducted themselves while doing our due diligence\u201d made him think again, he told DL News. On March 19, ZKasino announced that it had closed a Series A funding round that put its valuation at $350 million. While it didn\u2019t disclose the amount raised, ZKasino listed venture firms MEXC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings among the investors. But Big Brain Holdings told DL News that it \u201cnever invested in ZKasino.\u201d MEXC ventures did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. ZKasino\u2019s founders were previously involved in a separate project, a decentralised exchange on the zkSync blockchain called ZigZag Exchange. According to a ZigZag X post on March 23, ZigZag raised $15 million, which went into addresses controlled by the ZKasino founders. The wallets were multi-signature wallets, meaning that they needed multiple parties to sign off on transactions. ZigZag alleged in its post that the ZKasino founders stole the funds from the ZigZag treasury. \u201cThey would claim they were taking money out to pay devs for building the ZigZag front-end, then use parts of the money to build out ZKasino,\u201d the ZigZag post claimed. \u201cYou are an envious loser,\u201d Derivatives Monke, likely to be Nourzai himself, said in response, accusing ZigZag of instead losing all the money in trades gone wrong. \u201cYou gave up on ZigZag after raising when our whole team kept pushing you on a daily basis to get things moving.\u201d DL News attempted to reach the person posting from the ZigZag X account to elaborate on the allegations but was unsuccessful. Nourzai, likely the person behind the Derivatives Monke account, did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Dozens of ZKasino depositors are seeking ways to get their money back. But previous clawback attempts from crypto projects have had limited success. Victims of the $530 million theft on the Waves blockchain in 2022 have yet to receive recourse. Many investors in crypto yield platform Finblox, who had their deposits forcibly converted into newly created tokens \u2014 a similar situation to ZKasino \u2014 are also still out of pocket. ZKasino depositors hope to buck this trend. Dutch authorities making an arrest in connection with ZKasino could be a breakthrough in recovering the funds. \u201cI should\u2019ve dug a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done many coin launches and have done pretty well with them,\u201d Dylan Grover, an investor who deposited around $7,500 to ZKasino, told DL News. Grover is not alone. Thousands of wallets, presumably belonging to individual investors, locked up their Ether on ZKasino with expectation they would be able to withdraw it. \u201cI have demanded recompensation \u2026 but no recompensation has arrived,\u201d wrote the ZigZag poster. \u201cToken holders should attempt to get restitution on their own now.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Friend.tech has airdropped its token, FRIEND.\nThe SocialFi protocol has seen little activity since it burst onto the scene last summer.",
                "body": " Last year\u2019s SocialFi starlet Friend.tech is hoping to recapture the market\u2019s attention with the launch of its new token. The crypto-based platform that allows users to buy and sell shares linked to accounts on X distributed 13,349,967 tokens to early users FRIEND token on early Friday morning. SocialFi is short for social finance, a trend in Web3 that blends social media networks with financialization. The token traded as high as $169 shortly after launch as users rushed to buy the new token. By early morning, the token had fallen sharply, trading at just $2.02. As promised, the entire supply of newly issued tokens was distributed to people who had accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d by using the protocol. It was a bold, retail-friendly move by the protocol\u2019s developers. Typically, more than half of a new token\u2019s supply is set aside by the founding team for venture investors, employees, and nonprofit organisations tasked with promoting the project by issuing grants and the like. Besides today\u2019s airdrop, the project has fallen from its heady days of last year. For a brief moment, Friend.tech was the most-talked about project in the Ethereum ecosystem, processing roughly $10 million in daily trading volume and luring more than 800,000 cumulative users. That was in the late summer and fall of 2023. Since then, those numbers have fallen off a cliff. Thursday\u2019s airdrop will be the latest to test whether free tokens are enough to resuscitate an overlooked project. Launched on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base, Friend.tech lets users buy keys to chatrooms of other users. There is a 10% fee when purchasing a key, with 5% going to the key owner and 5% going to the team. Within months of its August launch, Friend.tech was growing at a rapid clip. It attracted crypto influencers and performers from OnlyFans, an online adult content site, and spawned more than a dozen copycats. By mid-October 2023, more than 600,000 accounts had used the site, according to data compiled by pseudonymous analyst Whale Hunter. Then the venture hit the wall. Its user base stalled at 800,000 and its monthly protocol revenue fell 90% from its high in September to $1 million in December. The broader SocialFi ecosystem, which is designed to let users profit off their followers, also cratered after enjoying a fleeting moment of relative popularity. Friend.tech got a boost after detailing plans for its airdrop and an upgrade dubbed \u201cV2.\u201d On March 22, Friend.tech announced it would distribute the entirety of its airdrop to users who had been accumulating points by using the protocol. In Friend.tech V1, users accumulated points every Friday, primarily influenced by the volume of Ether they deposited into the platform. Some 90 million points were distributed to users in V1 with another 10 million slated for distribution in V2. Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s founder, 0xracer, shared a preview of V2, which is set to include a native decentralised exchange, tradable collectibles, and enhancements to Friend.tech\u2019s chatroom user experience. Total transactions, USD deposits, and protocol fees all made yearly highs in early April. On April 8, the protocol saw over $7.4 million in deposits \u2014 the largest single day of deposits since October 25. The bump was short-lived. Friend.tech hasn\u2019t seen more than $50,000 in user deposits in a single day since April 16, according to data compiled by 21Shares, a provider of crypto investment products.

                "keypoints": "Interest rates will be higher for longer.\nThe latest dip was a fire-sale moment for Solana.",
                "body": " Even as the Federal Reserve signals higher interest rates for longer, Solana is bucking the trend. The blockchain\u2019s native SOL token rallied a whopping 12% overnight, making it the biggest bullish mover among the market\u2019s top 10 largest tokens. The move comes despite hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. He signaled that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates high \u2014 which is often bearish for stocks and cryptocurrencies \u2014 as it fights inflation. Bitcoin and Ethereum, up 2% and 3%, respectively, have yet to fully recover after Powell\u2019s comments. Only SOL has managed to recoup gains shed earlier this week. Alex Kr\u00fcger, a co-founder of crypto advisory boutique Asgard Markets, said that investors used a drop in prices to buy up even more SOL and other \u201csmall-cap\u201d tokens. \u201cPeople bid on what they thought was the strongest once they thought the bottom may be in,\u201d he told DL News. Other market movers Wednesday included buzzy memecoins Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. The latter two coins were also built and launched on Solana and have been a boon for the network. Earlier this year, the memecoin frenzy, spearheaded by Bonk and Dogwifhat, generated more fees on Solana than they did on Ethereum. Brian Rudick, senior strategist director at GSR, said that Thursday\u2019s rally also has memecoins to thank. \u201cMany memecoins like Bonk and dogwifhat are rallying, leading to hopes of rising daily active users, DEX trading volumes, and transaction fees for the network,\u201d he said. In addition to the Fed\u2019s indication that it will keep rates higher for longer, the FTX estate\u2019s $7.5 billion stash in Solana tokens has haunted the cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy estate of the collapsed crypto exchange said it would sell its holdings on the market to make creditors whole. The large ongoing sale has spurred investors like Galaxy Digital and Pantera to scoop up the discounted assets and act as a backstop. Pantera has even launched a bespoke fund of $250 million to buy more Solana. Despite the millions in tokens being sold, Michael Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, says the auctions are already reflected in the price. Douro Labs is the core contributor to the popular Solana oracle network Pyth. \u201cThe market has been pricing in the FTX SOL sales for the last few weeks, and now that there has been some news, it\u2019s rebounding,\u201d Cahill told DL News, highlighting the next tranche of SOL tokens expected to hit the market soon.

                "headline": "Why bulls believe Bitcoin ETFs will hit $100bn in assets later this year",
                "keypoints": "Bitcoin rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $57,756.\nEthereum jumped 3.2% to $2,927.",
                "body": " Bitcoin may be slumping these days but the advent of ETFs for the top cryptocurrency is a game changer that is only getting started. Indeed, the funds offered by BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit, Fidelity, and Ark Investment may collectively double in size, to more than $100 billion in assets, by the first quarter of 2025. That\u2019s the take from Brian Evans, the CEO BDE Ventures, an investment firm that backs web3, DeFi, and blockchain startups. \u201cI could see the total amount of capital held in these US-based BTC ETFs possibly doubling by the end of the year or going into early next year,\u201d Evans told DL News. To hit the $100 billion mark, the price of Bitcoin would have to reach the $100,000 target by the end of the third quarter, he said. Bitcoin stabilised after dropping almost 10% in the last seven days as investors braced for the Federal Reserve\u2019s committee meeting Wednesday. The Fed signalled that interest rates will not be cut anytime soon because a robust US economy is raising the risk of a resurgence in inflation. Investors\u2019 demand for Bitcoin ETFs has dropped in recent weeks as the macro story turns against \u201crisk-on\u201d assets including equities and crypto. The market has turned fragile since the giddy highs following the listing of the funds in January. Cumulative flows to Bitcoin ETFs have dropped almost 8% in the last two and a half weeks, to 11,254 Bitcoin daily, according to data from Farside Investors. But the crypto investing cycle has been forever changed by the funds and this will play out in the long run, analysts say. In the past, financial institutions have hesitated to throw money behind cryptocurrencies and opted instead to invest in the development of blockchain technology itself. That kept a lot of capital on the sidelines. Demand from institutional investors has been slow in the last five months. It was retail investors who truly drove Bitcoin to an all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. Yet spot price Bitcoin ETFs are so liquid to trade that they are bound to become more attractive to institutional investors, market experts say. And the regulated products are issued by some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, which should ease concerns about their safety. The next chapter will hinge on investment advisers, who influence the ebb and flow of capital into the markets. They are likely to start allocating their clients\u2019 assets into Bitcoin ETFs as part of portfolio diversification, Brian Rudick, senior strategist at trading firm GSR, told DL News. When that happens, a new inflow of money will bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThis is likely to be a slow process that plays out over the next few years, but it will be extremely powerful, much stickier, and amount to steady buy demand,\u201d Rudick said.
