                "body": "MakerDAO, the creator of the DAI stablecoin, is experiencing high demand for its product, leading to a unanimous governance vote to double the D3M maximum debt ceiling to 2.5 billion DAI. The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

The project's co-founder, Rune Christensen, has proposed upgrading the governance token and decentralized stablecoin DAI. However, an upgraded version may not be the solution. MakerDAO aims to scale the supply of DAI to 100 billion and more, but it has failed to impact the stablecoin market. Despite an increase in total value locked (TVL), DAI's volume has been lagging. Development activity has also decreased, suggesting a slowdown in network upgrades. Market players should keep an eye on DAI and MKR to see the potential effects of the proposal.",

The proposal includes adjustments to stability fees, borrowing rates, and other measures aimed at managing DAI's availability and encouraging its use. Additionally, the MakerDAO network has seen a 24% increase in activity over the last month, and the price of MKR has risen by 4.77% in the last 24 hours, indicating a growing interest in the platform.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

This decline occurs despite a double-digit increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",
