                "body": "MakerDAO, the creator of the DAI stablecoin, is experiencing high demand for its product, leading to a unanimous governance vote to double the D3M maximum debt ceiling to 2.5 billion DAI. The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

The project's co-founder, Rune Christensen, has proposed upgrading the governance token and decentralized stablecoin DAI. However, an upgraded version may not be the solution. MakerDAO aims to scale the supply of DAI to 100 billion and more, but it has failed to impact the stablecoin market. Despite an increase in total value locked (TVL), DAI's volume has been lagging. Development activity has also decreased, suggesting a slowdown in network upgrades. Market players should keep an eye on DAI and MKR to see the potential effects of the proposal.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today.

The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar.

THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF MAKERDAO\u2019S [MKR] DECENTRALIZED STABLECOIN DAI, HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE AUGUST 2023, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM MAKERBURN. A DECREASE IN DAI SUPPLY STEMS FROM THE PROTOCOL\u2019S COLLATERALIZED DEBT POSITION (CDP) MODEL, WHICH OPERATES AS A SELF-REGULATING MARKET. WHEN THE PRICES OF THE ASSETS BACKING THE STABLECOIN DECLINE, THE INTEREST RATE FOR BORROWING DAI ON THE PLATFORM RALLIES. THIS MAKES BORROWING COSTLIER, PROMPTING NEW BORROWERS TO STEER CLEAR OF TAKING OUT NEW LOANS AND MAKING EXISTING BORROWERS QUICKLY REPAY THEIR LOANS TO AVOID HIGH FEES. ALL OF THESE THEN CULMINATE IN A DECREASE IN THE OVERALL DAI SUPPLY. AMBCRYPTO OBSERVED THAT MOST OF THE DECLINE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 30TH AND 31ST OF JANUARY WHEN DAI\u2019S SUPPLY FELL BY 6%. FOR CONTEXT, THE STABLECOIN\u2019S SUPPLY DECREASED FROM 5.2 BILLION TO 4 BILLION DURING THE 24-HOUR PERIOD.

THIS INDICATOR MEASURES THE STRENGTH AND DIRECTION OF A TREND OF AN ASSET OVER A GIVEN PERIOD. AT PRESS TIME, MKR\u2019S AO INDICATOR RETURNED RED UPWARD-FACING HISTOGRAM BARS.

                "body": "Following a decline in its supply at the close of 2023, MakerDAO's DAI has seen a supply surge since the year began. After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

This growth is largely attributed to the rising interest in its stablecoin, DAI, which has become a preferred choice for many due to the current bullish market sentiment. In response to the high demand for DAI, MakerDAO introduced an accelerated proposal for an executive vote to ensure DAI's stability. The proposal includes adjustments to stability fees, borrowing rates, and other measures aimed at managing DAI's availability and encouraging its use. Additionally, the MakerDAO network has seen a 24% increase in activity over the last month, and the price of MKR has risen by 4.77% in the last 24 hours, indicating a growing interest in the platform.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

                "body": "MakerDAO, the creator of the DAI stablecoin, is experiencing high demand for its product, leading to a unanimous governance vote to double the D3M maximum debt ceiling to 2.5 billion DAI. The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today.

THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF MAKERDAO\u2019S [MKR] DECENTRALIZED STABLECOIN DAI, HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE AUGUST 2023, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM MAKERBURN. A DECREASE IN DAI SUPPLY STEMS FROM THE PROTOCOL\u2019S COLLATERALIZED DEBT POSITION (CDP) MODEL, WHICH OPERATES AS A SELF-REGULATING MARKET. WHEN THE PRICES OF THE ASSETS BACKING THE STABLECOIN DECLINE, THE INTEREST RATE FOR BORROWING DAI ON THE PLATFORM RALLIES. THIS MAKES BORROWING COSTLIER, PROMPTING NEW BORROWERS TO STEER CLEAR OF TAKING OUT NEW LOANS AND MAKING EXISTING BORROWERS QUICKLY REPAY THEIR LOANS TO AVOID HIGH FEES. ALL OF THESE THEN CULMINATE IN A DECREASE IN THE OVERALL DAI SUPPLY. AMBCRYPTO OBSERVED THAT MOST OF THE DECLINE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 30TH AND 31ST OF JANUARY WHEN DAI\u2019S SUPPLY FELL BY 6%. FOR CONTEXT, THE STABLECOIN\u2019S SUPPLY DECREASED FROM 5.2 BILLION TO 4 BILLION DURING THE 24-HOUR PERIOD.

THE RETURNED CMF VALUE OF 0.03 WAS A SIGN OF STRENGTH IN THE MARKET. IT SHOWED THAT TOKEN ACCUMULATION EXCEEDED SELLING ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, WHILE ACCUMULATION PERSISTED, THE STATE OF MKR\u2019S AWESOME OSCILLATOR (AO) SHOWED THE NEED FOR INVESTORS TO BE CAUTIOUS. THIS INDICATOR MEASURES THE STRENGTH AND DIRECTION OF A TREND OF AN ASSET OVER A GIVEN PERIOD. AT PRESS TIME, MKR\u2019S AO INDICATOR RETURNED RED UPWARD-FACING HISTOGRAM BARS.

                    "body": "Following a decline in its supply at the close of 2023, MakerDAO's DAI has seen a supply surge since the year began. After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

This collaboration allows users to borrow Ethna\u2019s stablecoins, USDE and sUSDE, at highly efficient leveraged positions backed by MakerDAO. Ethna\u2019s USDE is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu, and Cobo. sUSDE is a value accruing \u201cinternet bond,\u201d or a staked version of the USDE asset. Additionally, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker\u2019s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued. This collaboration has been driven by MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan, with Spark Protocol being part of a newly formed subDAO in the Maker ecosystem. Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked that Morpho\u2019s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending is being embraced by DeFi\u2019s largest and fastest-growing protocols, allowing users to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users. Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

This decline occurs despite a double-digit increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar. High borrowing costs on MakerDAO discourage new loans and prompt debt repayment, leading to a supply drop. Meanwhile, MKR's value has grown, reaching its highest price level since April 2022, despite potential indicators of a short-term drawback.",

The changes, prompted by a sudden drop in DAI supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion, include increasing the DAI savings rate from 5% to 15% and the stability fees of its core vaults by around 9-10%. These measures aim to shore up the protocol's reserves, which have diminished due to the drop in supply and potential liquidity crunch from more DAI selling. The proposal, submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council, also addresses the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure towards stablecoins deployed through real-world asset (RWA) vehicles. While the changes are meant to be temporary, there is no automatic mechanism for the reversion of the fees, raising concerns about potential market disruptions.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today.

                "body": "Following a decline in its supply at the close of 2023, MakerDAO's DAI has seen a supply surge since the year began. After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The proposal was put forward by the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) team, suggesting that the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of DAI be adjusted to 0% on all Aave deployments, and that sDAI incentives be removed from the merit program, effective from merit round 2 and beyond. This move is intended to respond to the aggressive actions of MakerDAO's recent D3M plan, which has increased the risk of DAI as collateral by causing the DAI credit line to grow from zero to a predicted 600 million DAI in less than a month, and may increase to 1 billion DAI in the short term. Considering that only a small portion of DAI deposits are currently used as collateral on Aave, and users can easily switch to USDC or USDT as alternative collateral options, the proposal aims to mitigate potential risks without significantly affecting the user base.",

Additionally, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker\u2019s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued. This collaboration has been driven by MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan, with Spark Protocol being part of a newly formed subDAO in the Maker ecosystem. Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked that Morpho\u2019s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending is being embraced by DeFi\u2019s largest and fastest-growing protocols, allowing users to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users. Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator. It also follows Aave\u2019s decision to exclude Morpho users from its latest alignment reward program.",

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states.

It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states.

High borrowing costs on MakerDAO discourage new loans and prompt debt repayment, leading to a supply drop. Meanwhile, MKR's value has grown, reaching its highest price level since April 2022, despite potential indicators of a short-term drawback.",

The changes, prompted by a sudden drop in DAI supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion, include increasing the DAI savings rate from 5% to 15% and the stability fees of its core vaults by around 9-10%. These measures aim to shore up the protocol's reserves, which have diminished due to the drop in supply and potential liquidity crunch from more DAI selling. The proposal, submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council, also addresses the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure towards stablecoins deployed through real-world asset (RWA) vehicles. While the changes are meant to be temporary, there is no automatic mechanism for the reversion of the fees, raising concerns about potential market disruptions.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

This move aims to mitigate risks associated with MakerDAO's aggressive D3M plan, which expanded the DAI credit line significantly. The proposal seeks to minimize user impact, as only a small portion of DAI serves as collateral on AAVE, and users have the option to switch to USDC or USDT. Additionally, the proposal highlights the risks of stablecoin depegging, exemplified by the hacking of Angle's agEUR minted into Euler. MakerDAO is preparing for its 'Endgame' transformation to scale DAI's market capitalization significantly, with plans to rebrand and engage an external marketing firm.

This move is intended to respond to the aggressive actions of MakerDAO's recent D3M plan, which has increased the risk of DAI as collateral by causing the DAI credit line to grow from zero to a predicted 600 million DAI in less than a month, and may increase to 1 billion DAI in the short term.

This collaboration allows users to borrow Ethna\u2019s stablecoins, USDE and sUSDE, at highly efficient leveraged positions backed by MakerDAO. Ethna\u2019s USDE is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu, and Cobo. sUSDE is a value accruing \u201cinternet bond,\u201d or a staked version of the USDE asset. Additionally, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker\u2019s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued. This collaboration has been driven by MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan, with Spark Protocol being part of a newly formed subDAO in the Maker ecosystem. Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked that Morpho\u2019s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending is being embraced by DeFi\u2019s largest and fastest-growing protocols, allowing users to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users. Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator.

                "body": "MakerDAO, the creator of the DAI stablecoin, is experiencing high demand for its product, leading to a unanimous governance vote to double the D3M maximum debt ceiling to 2.5 billion DAI. The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated. The sustainability of current rate levels and the future of high stablecoin yields are under discussion.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November.

Chaos Labs, a risk management contractor for AAVEDAO, proposed a 12% reduction in the DAI loan-to-value ratio after the stablecoin became partially backed by eUSD. The debate continues over the limits to DAI collateral as Chaos Labs offers a new proposal to reduce DAI LTV by 12%, following an earlier suggestion by AAVE Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller for a 75% reduction. AAVE is a crypto lending platform governed by AAVE token holders forming AAVEDAO. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol, governed by MakerDAO, which was criticized for minting 600 million DAI and depositing it in a vault with decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Critics claim eUSD is a risky asset and MakerDAO is being overly aggressive in using it for collateral purposes. Chaos Labs suggests a 12% reduction in LTV, allowing borrowers to use DAI as collateral but requiring a greater collateral-to-loan ratio. The nature of stablecoin eUSD, issued by the Ethene Protocol, is a key issue in the debate, with critics claiming it can become under-collateralized in certain circumstances.",

The proposal seeks to minimize user impact, as only a small portion of DAI serves as collateral on AAVE, and users have the option to switch to USDC or USDT. Additionally, the proposal highlights the risks of stablecoin depegging, exemplified by the hacking of Angle's agEUR minted into Euler.

Ethna\u2019s USDE is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu, and Cobo. sUSDE is a value accruing \u201cinternet bond,\u201d or a staked version of the USDE asset. Additionally, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker\u2019s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued.

Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked that Morpho\u2019s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending is being embraced by DeFi\u2019s largest and fastest-growing protocols, allowing users to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users. Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

This growth is largely attributed to the rising interest in its stablecoin, DAI, which has become a preferred choice for many due to the current bullish market sentiment. In response to the high demand for DAI, MakerDAO introduced an accelerated proposal for an executive vote to ensure DAI's stability. The proposal includes adjustments to stability fees, borrowing rates, and other measures aimed at managing DAI's availability and encouraging its use. Additionally, the MakerDAO network has seen a 24% increase in activity over the last month, and the price of MKR has risen by 4.77% in the last 24 hours, indicating a growing interest in the platform.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

This decline occurs despite a double-digit increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar. High borrowing costs on MakerDAO discourage new loans and prompt debt repayment, leading to a supply drop. Meanwhile, MKR's value has grown, reaching its highest price level since April 2022, despite potential indicators of a short-term drawback.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Chaos Labs, a risk management contractor for AAVEDAO, proposed a 12% reduction in the DAI loan-to-value ratio after the stablecoin became partially backed by eUSD. The debate continues over the limits to DAI collateral as Chaos Labs offers a new proposal to reduce DAI LTV by 12%, following an earlier suggestion by AAVE Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller for a 75% reduction. AAVE is a crypto lending platform governed by AAVE token holders forming AAVEDAO. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol, governed by MakerDAO, which was criticized for minting 600 million DAI and depositing it in a vault with decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Critics claim eUSD is a risky asset and MakerDAO is being overly aggressive in using it for collateral purposes. Chaos Labs suggests a 12% reduction in LTV, allowing borrowers to use DAI as collateral but requiring a greater collateral-to-loan ratio. The nature of stablecoin eUSD, issued by the Ethene Protocol, is a key issue in the debate, with critics claiming it can become under-collateralized in certain circumstances.",

The proposal seeks to minimize user impact, as only a small portion of DAI serves as collateral on AAVE, and users have the option to switch to USDC or USDT. Additionally, the proposal highlights the risks of stablecoin depegging, exemplified by the hacking of Angle's agEUR minted into Euler. MakerDAO is preparing for its 'Endgame' transformation to scale DAI's market capitalization significantly, with plans to rebrand and engage an external marketing firm.

This collaboration allows users to borrow Ethna\u2019s stablecoins, USDE and sUSDE, at highly efficient leveraged positions backed by MakerDAO. Ethna\u2019s USDE is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu, and Cobo. sUSDE is a value accruing \u201cinternet bond,\u201d or a staked version of the USDE asset. Additionally, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker\u2019s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued. This collaboration has been driven by MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan, with Spark Protocol being part of a newly formed subDAO in the Maker ecosystem. Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked that Morpho\u2019s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending is being embraced by DeFi\u2019s largest and fastest-growing protocols, allowing users to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users. Maker\u2019s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator.

The D3M, or Decentralized Debt Markets Module, is designed to optimize DAI liquidity across different DeFi platforms by automatically adjusting DAI borrowing rates. This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

MakerDAO aims to scale the supply of DAI to 100 billion and more, but it has failed to impact the stablecoin market. Despite an increase in total value locked (TVL), DAI's volume has been lagging. Development activity has also decreased, suggesting a slowdown in network upgrades. Market players should keep an eye on DAI and MKR to see the potential effects of the proposal.",

The proposal includes adjustments to stability fees, borrowing rates, and other measures aimed at managing DAI's availability and encouraging its use.

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

AAVE is a crypto lending platform governed by AAVE token holders forming AAVEDAO. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol, governed by MakerDAO, which was criticized for minting 600 million DAI and depositing it in a vault with decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Critics claim eUSD is a risky asset and MakerDAO is being overly aggressive in using it for collateral purposes. Chaos Labs suggests a 12% reduction in LTV, allowing borrowers to use DAI as collateral but requiring a greater collateral-to-loan ratio.

Ethna\u2019s USDE is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu, and Cobo. sUSDE is a value accruing \u201cinternet bond,\u201d or a staked version of the USDE asset.

Sam MacPherson, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs \u2014 the infrastructure company behind Spark \u2014 noted that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem. While Sparklend\u2019s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave V3\u2019s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools.

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

This growth is largely attributed to the rising interest in its stablecoin, DAI, which has become a preferred choice for many due to the current bullish market sentiment. In response to the high demand for DAI, MakerDAO introduced an accelerated proposal for an executive vote to ensure DAI's stability. The proposal includes adjustments to stability fees, borrowing rates, and other measures aimed at managing DAI's availability and encouraging its use. Additionally, the MakerDAO network has seen a 24% increase in activity over the last month, and the price of MKR has risen by 4.77% in the last 24 hours, indicating a growing interest in the platform.",

The proposal for these changes comes amid a sudden drop in DAI supply, which fell from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the past week. The proposal was submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council. Although DAI is over-collateralized, some of the collateral is tied up in real-world asset (RWA) instruments. This situation could lead to a liquidity squeeze if DAI sales continue. \u201cLiquid stable reserves and reserves transferred to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure created by potential bull market sentiment,\u201d the proposal states. It also highlights the issue of a liquidity crunch due to exposure to stablecoins distributed through RWAs. A number of changes have been approved to stabilize the situation and will be implemented from today. These include increasing the DAI accumulation rate from 5% to 15% and increasing the stability fees of the main vaults by approximately 9-10% each. While these changes are intended to be temporary, there does not appear to be an automatic mechanism to roll back the fees.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

                "body": "Stablecoin DAI has experienced a significant drop in supply since the beginning of March, reaching its lowest level since August 2023 at 4.42 million DAI. This decline occurs despite a double-digit increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The decrease in DAI's supply is attributed to the protocol's collateralized debt position (CDP) model, designed to maintain its value to the U.S. dollar. High borrowing costs on MakerDAO discourage new loans and prompt debt repayment, leading to a supply drop. Meanwhile, MKR's value has grown, reaching its highest price level since April 2022, despite potential indicators of a short-term drawback.",

The changes, prompted by a sudden drop in DAI supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion, include increasing the DAI savings rate from 5% to 15% and the stability fees of its core vaults by around 9-10%. These measures aim to shore up the protocol's reserves, which have diminished due to the drop in supply and potential liquidity crunch from more DAI selling. The proposal, submitted by BA Labs, a member of Maker's Stability Advisory Council, also addresses the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure towards stablecoins deployed through real-world asset (RWA) vehicles. While the changes are meant to be temporary, there is no automatic mechanism for the reversion of the fees, raising concerns about potential market disruptions.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November.

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November.

A DECREASE IN DAI SUPPLY STEMS FROM THE PROTOCOL\u2019S COLLATERALIZED DEBT POSITION (CDP) MODEL, WHICH OPERATES AS A SELF-REGULATING MARKET. WHEN THE PRICES OF THE ASSETS BACKING THE STABLECOIN DECLINE, THE INTEREST RATE FOR BORROWING DAI ON THE PLATFORM RALLIES. THIS MAKES BORROWING COSTLIER, PROMPTING NEW BORROWERS TO STEER CLEAR OF TAKING OUT NEW LOANS AND MAKING EXISTING BORROWERS QUICKLY REPAY THEIR LOANS TO AVOID HIGH FEES. ALL OF THESE THEN CULMINATE IN A DECREASE IN THE OVERALL DAI SUPPLY. AMBCRYPTO OBSERVED THAT MOST OF THE DECLINE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 30TH AND 31ST OF JANUARY WHEN DAI\u2019S SUPPLY FELL BY 6%. FOR CONTEXT, THE STABLECOIN\u2019S SUPPLY DECREASED FROM 5.2 BILLION TO 4 BILLION DURING THE 24-HOUR PERIOD. AT PRESS TIME, MAKERDAO\u2019S NATIVE TOKEN MKR EXCHANGED HANDS AT $2,009, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM COINMARKETCAP.

HOWEVER, THEY HAVE FAILED TO INITIATE ANY SIGNIFICANT PRICE DECLINE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE ALTCOIN CONTINUES TO ENJOY A SUSTAINED STREAM OF DEMAND. AT PRESS TIME, ITS RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX (RSI) WAS 56.14 AND WAS IN AN UPTREND. THIS SUGGESTED THAT WHILE A BEAR CYCLE MIGHT HAVE COMMENCED, THE BULLS CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE MKR TOKENS. CONFIRMING THE STEADY LIQUIDITY INFLOW INTO THE MKR MARKET, ITS CHAIKIN MONEY FLOW (CMF) WAS IN AN UPTREND ABOVE THE ZERO LINE AT PRESS TIME. THE RETURNED CMF VALUE OF 0.03 WAS A SIGN OF STRENGTH IN THE MARKET. IT SHOWED THAT TOKEN ACCUMULATION EXCEEDED SELLING ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, WHILE ACCUMULATION PERSISTED, THE STATE OF MKR\u2019S AWESOME OSCILLATOR (AO) SHOWED THE NEED FOR INVESTORS TO BE CAUTIOUS. THIS INDICATOR MEASURES THE STRENGTH AND DIRECTION OF A TREND OF AN ASSET OVER A GIVEN PERIOD. AT PRESS TIME, MKR\u2019S AO INDICATOR RETURNED RED UPWARD-FACING HISTOGRAM BARS. THIS SUGGESTED THAT THE ACCUMULATION PRESSURE WAS WEAK COMPARED TO THE UNDERLYING BEARISH SENTIMENT, WHICH HAD A LONGER-TERM HORIZON.

                    "body": "Following a decline in its supply at the close of 2023, MakerDAO's DAI has seen a supply surge since the year began. After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL).

The debate continues over the limits to DAI collateral as Chaos Labs offers a new proposal to reduce DAI LTV by 12%, following an earlier suggestion by AAVE Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller for a 75% reduction. AAVE is a crypto lending platform governed by AAVE token holders forming AAVEDAO. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol, governed by MakerDAO, which was criticized for minting 600 million DAI and depositing it in a vault with decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Critics claim eUSD is a risky asset and MakerDAO is being overly aggressive in using it for collateral purposes. Chaos Labs suggests a 12% reduction in LTV, allowing borrowers to use DAI as collateral but requiring a greater collateral-to-loan ratio. The nature of stablecoin eUSD, issued by the Ethene Protocol, is a key issue in the debate, with critics claiming it can become under-collateralized in certain circumstances.",

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Additionally, the proposal highlights the risks of stablecoin depegging, exemplified by the hacking of Angle's agEUR minted into Euler. MakerDAO is preparing for its 'Endgame' transformation to scale DAI's market capitalization significantly, with plans to rebrand and engage an external marketing firm.

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

Key findings include vulnerabilities such as auctions being prone to transaction-reordering attacks, the use of ABIEncoderV2 which is not yet considered production-ready, and discrepancies in the k-dss repository compared to others. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the incomplete implementation of the auth-checker's `checkRely` function and the presence of too many varying notions of \"permission\" within the system. These issues are categorized for severity and are discussed in detail in Section 4 of the report. For improvements, it is suggested that the project should address these security concerns in both the short and long term, as outlined in the recommendations summary of the audit report.",

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins.

CONFIRMING THE STEADY LIQUIDITY INFLOW INTO THE MKR MARKET, ITS CHAIKIN MONEY FLOW (CMF) WAS IN AN UPTREND ABOVE THE ZERO LINE AT PRESS TIME. THE RETURNED CMF VALUE OF 0.03 WAS A SIGN OF STRENGTH IN THE MARKET. IT SHOWED THAT TOKEN ACCUMULATION EXCEEDED SELLING ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, WHILE ACCUMULATION PERSISTED, THE STATE OF MKR\u2019S AWESOME OSCILLATOR (AO) SHOWED THE NEED FOR INVESTORS TO BE CAUTIOUS. THIS INDICATOR MEASURES THE STRENGTH AND DIRECTION OF A TREND OF AN ASSET OVER A GIVEN PERIOD. AT PRESS TIME, MKR\u2019S AO INDICATOR RETURNED RED UPWARD-FACING HISTOGRAM BARS. THIS SUGGESTED THAT THE ACCUMULATION PRESSURE WAS WEAK COMPARED TO THE UNDERLYING BEARISH SENTIMENT, WHICH HAD A LONGER-TERM HORIZON.

After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL).

This increase was motivated by the rapidly accelerating demand for loans at Sparklend, a sub-DAO within Maker, which saw available DAI fall to 250 million. MakerDAO recently more than doubled stability fees and the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) jumped from 5% to 15%. Stablecoin yield opportunities are rising, leading traders to swap DAI borrowed at low rates for higher yielding stablecoins. This puts pressure on DAI's dollar peg and pushed Maker's PSM module to record lows. Despite the changes, some believe the impact of new entrants like Ethena on Maker's rate increase is overstated.

                    "body": "Following a decline in its supply at the close of 2023, MakerDAO's DAI has seen a supply surge since the year began. After hitting a four-month low on the 31st of December 2023, the supply of MakerDAO's stablecoin, DAI, has witnessed a remarkable rebound in the first weeks of 2024, data from MakerBurn showed. It was found that DAI's supply had plummeted to a low of 5.22 billion DAI on 31st December 2023. This decline was attributed to the sideways movements in the price of Ethereum (ETH) as 2023 neared its end due to the anticipation around a spot ETF approval at the time.\nThe contraction in DAI supply was due to the DeFi protocol's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model. MakerDAO CDP allows its users to generate DAI by collateralizing cryptocurrencies, such as ETH. The MakerDAO CDP model maintains DAI stablecoin's value at $1 through interest rate incentives. With the year so far marked by an uptick in ETH's value, fueled by the excitement around the recent ETF approval, DAI's supply has grown. At 5.29 billion at press time, DAI's supply has risen by almost 2% from the 31st December low.\nDespite the decline in DAI supply in December, user activity on MakerDAO climbed. Data from Token Terminal showed that the protocol recorded a monthly user count of 2,775 during the 31-day period, marking a 55% uptick from the 1,837 monthly users recorded in November. However, in spite of the spike in its number of users, the fees recorded totaled $15 million, declining 48% from the $28 million recorded in November. Likewise, protocol revenue saw a 48% decrease during the same window period, AMBCrypto found. Amid all these, MakerDAO has managed a 3.24% rally in Total Value Locked (TVL). According to data from DeFiLlama, the protocol's TVL was $8.83 billion at press time, making it the second largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, ranking after Lido Finance (LDO), with a TVL of $24.33 billion.",

There is an emphasis on the need for synchronization across repositories, as seen with the k-dss being out of sync, and a call for more robust authentication mechanisms, as the auth-checker's use of checkRely is deemed incomplete. Additionally, the issue of having too many different notions of \"permission\" suggests a lack of standardization that could lead to security loopholes. The findings suggest that while there is a strong knowledge base, there is room for improvement in the areas of security practices, codebase management, and standardization. Future work should include fortifying authentication processes, ensuring consistency across code repositories, and establishing clearer permission structures to enhance the security and reliability of smart contracts.",
