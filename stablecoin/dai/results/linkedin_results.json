They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

It contains all the adapters and auction contracts for one specific collateral type.\n\n\u2022 Rates Module: Accumulates stability fees on Vault debt balances, as well as interest on Dai Savings Rate (DSR) deposits.\n\n\u2022 Dai Module: Contains the DAI token contract and all its key functionalities.\n\n\u2022 Oracle Module: An oracle module is deployed for each collateral type, feeding it the price data for a corresponding collateral type to the Vat.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Proxy Module: Contains contract interfaces, proxies, and aliases to functions necessary for both DSR and Vault management and Maker governance.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Peg Stability Module: Enables quick swapping of DAI with other stablecoins at a rate of 1:1 by creating a pooled collateralized-debt position with 100% collateralization ratio and 0% stability fees.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Flash Module: Allows anyone to mint Dai up to a limit set by Maker Governance with the one condition that they pay it all back in the same transaction with a fee.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Emergency Shutdown Module: It has the ability to trigger the Shutdown of the Maker Protocol.\n\n\u2022\u00a0MKR Module: Contains the MKR token, which is an ERC20 token that provides a standard ERC20 token interface.

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",
