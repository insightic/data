            "headline": "AI hype in crypto pushes Bittensor subnet fees by 10,000%",
            "keypoints": "Bittensor's subnet registration cost soared to $6.7 million, a 10,000% increase.\nHigh registration costs and a cap on subnets are sparking debates on innovation and network expansion within Bittensor.\nProposals to increase subnet numbers face concerns about diluting quality and attracting profit-driven registrations.",
            "body": " As the AI hype in crypto continues to heat up, the cost to register a subnet on the leading AI-related network, Bittensor, has reached $6.7 million \u2014 its highest price ever Subnets are specialised networks integrated with the Bittensor blockchain, featuring their own miners and validators who carry out unique tasks, often related to AI. By deploying subnets, projects can tap into daily TAO emissions \u2014 issuance of the network\u2019s token \u2014 and engage a dedicated community of miners to execute specific tasks designated by the subnet. Just last month the cost to register a subnet was 100 TAO, or $53,000. It\u2019s gone up by more than 10,000% over the last month, reaching 10,127 TAO \u2014 $6.7 million \u2014 as of yesterday. This meteoric rise is driven by an explosion of AI projects registering subnets on Bittensor, seemingly to get in front of an eager community and a portion of the 7,200 TAO emitted daily. Every time a project registers a subnet the cost to register is doubled, and if no one registers, the price halves linearly over four days. The current costs are out of reach for even well funded ventures, leading to discussions on the rising costs of subnet registration. Some analysts worry that the current cap on subnets within the Bittensor network could be stifling innovation, suggesting that the high costs associated with the subnet registration are hindering experimentation. This plan would see the total number of subnets rise from 32 to either 48 or 64, or removed altogether. While others point out that such an expansion could lead to a surge in subnet registrations by entities primarily motivated by the prospect of receiving TAO emissions, thereby diluting the quality and purpose of the network. Bittensor is a blockchain that operates similarly to other proof-of-stake blockchains, utilising a decentralised network of validators to validate transactions, with users transacting using the TAO token. Where it differs is that it also has 32 subnets that each have their own set of miners and validators. The miners and validators on subnets are not like we know them on blockchains, instead, on subnets, validators provide tasks that miners must complete. Although the subnets all connect to the main blockchain, they all have their own distinct purposes and while many of them are AI-related, they do not need to be. Subnet 28, or the S&P 500 Oracle, has validators send miners a specific time in the future by which miners must make a price prediction on the S&P 500. Subnet 2, or BitTranslate, works by having validators forward text sent by users to miners to translate into another language. On subnets, miners and validators are graded based on the tasks set by each subnet, with the top performing miners and validators receiving a higher portion of TAO rewards than poor performers. The competition helps ensure that tasks are completed as accurately and quickly as possible. There is additional competition between each subnet as the subnets are graded by how much activity is generated on each subnet. Subnets that have a lot of activity are rewarded the most, ensuring that TAO emissions go to where demand is strongest. When a new subnet registers, the worst performing subnet, measured by the TAO emissions received, is deregistered, with the fee they paid to register returned to them. Each day 7,200 TAO is emitted to subnets, and consequently, miners and validators. 18% is given to the subnet owner, 42% to miners and 42% to validators. In the wake of soaring subnet registration costs on the Bittensor network, the community stands at a crossroads.The crux of the matter lies in balancing growth and innovation with the integrity and purpose of the ecosystem. As the network contemplates adjusting its cap on subnets, concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse, with some parties possibly looking to exploit the system for short-term gains rather than contributing long-term value. The fear is that by increasing the number of subnets, it might encourage a behaviour where entities register subnets primarily to harvest TAO emissions, without genuinely contributing to the network\u2019s development or offering valuable services. Other suggestions have been to burn a portion of the registration fee. Introducing this non-refundable cost could deter entities looking for quick gains, potentially reducing the overall number of new subnet registrations and ultimately to cost to register.

            "headline": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade will make DeFi a lot cheaper to use",
            "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
            "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun. (Metrika) VOTE: Aave to add GMX\u2019s gmETH to its Arbitrum liquidity pool VOTE: Jupiter DAO concludes vote on LFG launchpad candidates VOTE: Arbitrum votes on new $4 million grants programme Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin slaps back at an X user complaining about high transaction fees. Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

            "keypoints": "Bitcoin hit another new all-time high just above $71,000 on Monday.\nThis is the fourth time the cryptocurrency has broken its own record in a week.\nBreaking the $71,000 barrier comes as the Bitcoin price is starting to fuel ETF inflows, marking a change in investor behaviour.",
            "body": " Bitcoin surged past $71,000 on Monday morning, London time, breaking its own record for the fourth time in a week. The new record comes as the cryptocurrency is starting to drive inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to an analyst \u2014 not the other way around. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been attributed as a key driver behind the digital asset\u2019s recovery this year, but the head of research at crypto brokerage FalconX says that relationship is about to change. \u201cIf until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\u201d David Lawant posted on Thursday. The market is now entering a phase where Lawant expects to see more reflexivity, he added. Reflexivity refers to a feedback loop where market trends and the fundamentals influencing them can enhance each other. In this case, it would translate to the Bitcoin price soaring, which would then drive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would drive the price higher. Bitcoin broke its November 2021 all-time high three times over the past week: on Tuesday, Friday, and over the weekend, breaking the $69,100, $69,200, and $70,000 barrier, respectively. However, a more dramatic price hike may take a while, Lawant said. \u201cIf the past cycle is any guide, we might hover around the current levels for a while before decisively breaking into a new inning of the bull market trend,\u201d Lawant said. \u201cAll market signals so far indicate that the current bull market trend remains in place.\u201d On Tuesday, US Bitcoin ETFs trading in the spot market saw their largest daily net inflows since they began trading on January 11 at $648 million, according to Bitwise.

            "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
            "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
            "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

            "headline": "Bitcoin price may be settling, but more volatility is on the way, analysts warn",
            "keypoints": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has settled following a severe dip earlier in the week.\nAnalysts say the calm is allowing the market to play catch-up.\nStill, more volatility is coming, they warn.",
            "body": " Bitcoin has sailed into calmer waters since the biggest daily decline in almost two months on Tuesday, which saw its price surge to an all-time high of $69,100, before dipping 14%. The plunge triggered $1.2 billion in liquidations, resulting in the second-most challenging day for traders since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Now, traders have a chance to collect themselves as more volatility looms on the horizon, analysts say. Rather than causing market-wide panic, analysts and experts say the move was necessary for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term outlook as exchange-traded funds continue to prop up demand. \u201cOver the past 24 hours, the BTC price has been holding relatively steady, and its trading patterns seem quieter,\u201d Noelle Acheson, former head of market insights at Genesis and author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, said on Thursday. The asset is trading at $67,500, up 0.9% on the day. Following Bitcoin\u2019s recovery back above $66,000 on Wednesday, its price has been trading within a range of about 4.8%. The calm gives the market room to breathe while investors reassess their positions and strategies, Acheson said. \u201cIt also sets the stage for the next trend, which \u2014 given the relative strength of the tailwinds \u2014 is likely to be up,\u201d she said. The moves were necessary to flush out exuberance in derivatives and restore investor confidence, analysts told DL News following this week\u2019s severe price swings. \u201cWhenever excess leverage builds in a system, it needs a blow-off valve,\u201d Jonathan de Wet, chief investment officer at Zerocap, told DL News on Tuesday. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told DL News that Tuesday\u2019s $381 million washout in Bitcoin and Ethereum derivative long positions was a net positive for market health. Analysts like de Wet and Lawant posit demand from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds is bolstering buying pressure, which far exceeds miners\u2019 ability to supply new coins to the market. On Wednesday, spot Bitcoin ETFs notched their biggest net inflows, at $648 million, since they began trading on January 11, according to data from Bitcoin ETF provider Bitwise. That\u2019s despite Bitcoin\u2019s volatility reaching its highest point in almost a year. In other words, issuers still seem willing to buy Bitcoin to meet demand from their clients, even as Bitcoin ETF purchases recorded a drop of more than 50% from March 5 to March 6. \u201cThese types of sharp corrections are a staple of crypto bull markets, and I see the leverage washout as healthy,\u201d Lawant told DL News on Thursday. To be sure, Acheson warned earlier in the week that more violent market swings are coming. \u201cFroth is still with us, which suggests that the volatility will continue,\u201d Acheson said. Traders have taken increasingly riskier bets on Bitcoin as it moved toward record highs over the past week, adding additional risk and volatility to the market. Deribit\u2019s implied volatility index, DVOL, which indicates the expected movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price, supports Acheson\u2019s outlook. The index broke the 71% threshold on Tuesday for the first time since the collapse of FTX. It remains elevated around 69%, suggesting prices will continue to whipsaw.

            "keypoints": "Following a record-setting week with $84.5 billion in volume, the decentralized derivatives sector saw continued momentum as GMX hit $1 billion in trading volume on March 4.\nGMX offers liquidity providers yields ranging from 11.8% to 105.3% APY across its versions.\nDeFi yields have reached a new peak, with the market-wide average yield hitting 5.4%.",
            "body": " According to DefiLlama\u2019s yield overview page, GMX or protocols that operate on top of GMX now offer four out of the top 10 highest yields for protocols that have at least $10 million in deposits. GMX is a decentralised perpetual trading exchange deployed on the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains. Perpetual futures, often referred to as perpetual swaps or simply \u201cperps,\u201d are a derivative contract that enables traders to bet on the future value of an asset indefinitely without an expiration date. Liquidity providers on GMX V1 are earning a 35.6% annual percentage yield and liquidity providers on GMX V2 are earning 11.8% to 105.3%. The source of these yields is driven by the increase in perpetual futures trading. The decentralised derivatives sector hit an all-time high weekly volume of $84.5 billion during the week ended March 1. For GMX, the increase in volumes continued in the first week of the month, as it generated over $1 billion in trading volume on March 4, the highest daily amount since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The weekly volume for decentralised derivative protocols (DefiLlama) Contrary to centralised exchanges, decentralised exchanges generally don\u2019t use market makers, or middlemen who match buy and sell orders. Instead, they rely on users to deposit assets in a liquidity pool that other users can then trade from. With GMX V1, liquidity providers deposit into GLP, an index made up of Ether, Bitcoin, LINK, UNI, and stablecoins. Once a user deposits an asset into GLP, they are exposed to the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. On the other hand, GMX V2 doesn\u2019t use one basket of assets, but rather uses isolated pools for each asset. This allows liquidity providers to pick exactly which assets they want exposure to while providing liquidity. GMX V1 and GMX V2 combined have over $593 million in deposits. The assets deposited in these pools earn a portion of the fees paid by traders. On GMX V1, traders pay a 0.1% fee on the total size of their trade, while on GMX V2, the fee is slightly lower at between 0.05% and 0.07% of the trade size. There are additional fees, as well, like funding fees, which have recently risen due to the increase in trader demand for leverage. But these yields come with risks, too. As with any protocol, there are always smart contract risks such as bugs in the computer code or exploits from nefarious actors. Although GMX has received audits for V1 and V2, audits do not catch all potential risks. Additionally, liquidity providers on GMX are the counterparty to traders. When traders close a profitable trade, the profits for that trade come out of the liquidity pools. Driven by increases in yields offered by protocols like GMX, the market-wide DeFi yield just hit its highest level since March 3, 2022. The seven-day average yield, calculated over all tracked pools on DefiLlama on a given day, hit 5.4% yesterday. This is a 3.7 percentage point increase from the bear market low of 1.67% on September 26. Historical annual percentage yield in DeFi (DefiLlama) With an overall resurgence in decentralised finance, as seen in the total value of crypto assets deposited in protocols and total volume generated by decentralised exchanges hitting their highest levels in years, the yield could continue to increase. Furthermore, some of the highest yields are generated by decentralised derivatives exchanges like GMX, and compared with their centralised counterparts, there is room to grow. According to data from Rabbitx, decentralised derivative exchanges did $12 billion in total volume in the last 24 hours, while centralised exchanges did over $458 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

            "headline": "How an obscure 4chan meme gave birth to a cryptocurrency that went up 1,800%",
            "keypoints": "A memecoin based on \"mogging\" is one of the crypto bull market's top performers.\nThe mogging meme has links to misogyny and toxic masculinity, an internet culture researcher says.\nMembers of the Mog Coin community say the meme has transcended its origin.",
            "body": " With the crypto bull market in full swing, memecoins \u2014 tokens without any function or use case that trade solely on their popularity and sentiment \u2014 are soaring. Among the list of top performers is Mog Coin, launched in March 2023. It\u2019s up an eye-watering 1,800% over the past month amid a $6.4 billion memecoin trading frenzy in February. Mog Coin now trades at a market value of over $371 million. Mog Coin is the latest example of a meme from the fringes of the internet gaining popularity in crypto. The term \u201cmog,\u201d a corruption of the acronym \u201calpha male of the group,\u201d can be traced to posts on online forum 4chan as far back as 2016. \u201cTo \u2018mog\u2019 someone is to assert one\u2019s dominance over them \u2014 usually men \u2014 hoping to impress women,\u201d Si\u00e2n Brooke, a researcher at the London School of Economics who studies online communities, told DL News. Brooke said the term, which comes from the intersection of bodybuilding and pickup artist communities, is linked to ideas of misogyny and toxic masculinity. \u201cWomen are not valued in these communities but are objectified and seen as a prize to obtain,\u201d she said. But members of the Mog Coin community say the meme has transcended its original meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s about rising above the ordinary, striving for greatness, and manifesting our deepest desires and highest potential,\u201d Alphapriest777, a pseudonymous investor in Mog Coin, told DL News. \u201cThe underlying message is the same: We\u2019re here to level up, to support each other, and to leave a lasting impact,\u201d Alphapriest said. And mogging isn\u2019t the first time lingo from 4chan has crossed over into crypto. WAGMI, an acronym for \u201cwe\u2019re all gonna make it,\u201d which became a rallying cry among crypto investors during the previous bull run, also traces its origin to posts on 4chan and bodybuilding.com. The phrase was popularised by bodybuilder Aziz \u201cZyzz\u201d Shavershian in 2010 before crossing over into crypto circles around 2017. Financial trading has historically been a male-dominated world. In crypto, where trading risks \u2014 and rewards \u2014 are amplified, the same macho attitudes are also commonplace. One reason for this, according to Brooke, is that by owning crypto, \u201cmen can reflect ideal forms of masculinity through evidence of a willingness to take risks, display esoteric knowledge, and demonstrate fortitude and independence.\u201d The Mog Coin website says the memecoin is about confidence, success, and \u201cbeing the best version of yourself in anything you do.\u201d Alphapriest attributed Mog Coin\u2019s success to its culture of \u201cwinning, resilience, and rising above the mediocre\u201d and its \u201ccelebration of the hustle, the grind, and the unwavering belief in our own potential.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a daily reminder of what\u2019s possible when a group of like-minded, passionate individuals come together and decide to aim higher,\u201d Alphapriest said. However, there is often a darker side to how masculinity manifests itself in such online communities. A cornerstone of the mogging meme is \u201clooksmaxing,\u201d an idea popular among young men who want to change their appearance to become more attractive and gain social acceptance. It has roots in \u201clookism,\u201d a prejudice or discrimination toward people who are considered to be physically unattractive that is popular in incel circles. Tropes such as \u201calphas,\u201d a term used to denote men who embody the sexual and sporting success of mainstream, desirable masculinity, and \u201cbetas,\u201d the opposite of alphas, are common. Brooke said the concept of alphas and betas is tied to a toxic framing of gender in which women are denied personhood. \u201cThey are seen as irrational, interchangeable, hardwired to pair with alpha males, and needing to be dominated,\u201d she said. To what extent these ideas are actively propagated in the Mog Coin community is unclear. \u201cMemes often get away with being bigoted or sexist by claiming to be ironic,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cOnline, it\u2019s hard to tell when someone genuinely expresses themselves or mocks them unless they make their intentions clear.\u201d \u201cOf course, mog is much bigger than any acronym,\u201d Wolf, a pseudonymous admin in the official Mog Coin Telegram group \u2014 a messaging app \u2014 told DL News. When asked about Mog Coin\u2019s alpha male of the group origin, Wolf listed several alternative acronyms for mog, such as men of God, maiden of God, monkeys, orangutans, gorillas, multiple orgasm giver, and magical opportunity generator. Like with many other popular internet subcultures, nods to right-wing politics are also present in mogging and Mog Coin. On the official Mog Coin X account, a pinned video of a breakdancing Donald Trump sporting a pair of pit vipers \u2014 the iridescent sunglasses that have become synonymous with the Mog Coin community \u2014 greets potential initiates. It is also up for debate to what extent the broader Mog Coin community supports such uses of right-wing figures. Pepe, a memecoin based on comics artist Matt Furie\u2019s enduring Pepe the Frog character, has also previously been linked to right-wing circles. But the meme has broader appeal. While extremist groups sometimes co-opt Pepe the Frog to make racist memes, the character is broadly used in crypto circles to emote the ups and downs of crypto trading. The meme also became popular as a symbol of resistance during the 2019 Hong Kong democracy protests. Last year, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal publicly apologised on X after the crypto exchange labelled Pepe as an alt-right \u201chate symbol.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

            "body": " Bitcoin briefly touched record highs on Tuesday before it plunged as much as 12% to flutter around $60,000. The rapid rise and fall kicked off a cascade of liquidations across the market, marking the second worst day for traders since the collapse of FTX. Liquidations totalled more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data as of noon London time on Wednesday. Traders with long positions on Bitcoin and Ethereum lost nearly $340 million. Tuesday\u2019s \u201cleverage washout,\u201d in Bitcoin and Ethereum long positions, was the second-highest daily loss since November 2022, when the FTX crypto exchange crashed, according to David Lawant, head of research at crypto trading platform FalconX. It comes on the back of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds having stolen the limelight since their approval in January. \u201cThe market became myopically focused on the Bitcoin ETF narrative, ignoring the excessive leverage and positioning in the derivatives market,\u201d Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at research firm Real Vision, said on X following Bitcoin\u2019s drop. Bitcoin derivatives markets had shown signs of overheating leading up to the collapse, with Coutts and other analysts warning of a potential spike in volatility on Monday. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalisation was trading above $66,000 again on Wednesday, but prices could fall again, analysts warn. \u201cWhen positioning was as extreme as it was leading into the selloff, there is likely to be a bit more downside before that leverage is flushed out,\u201d Coutts told DL News. \u201cThe last pullback in January took over a month before it broke above new all-time highs. I expect in the next one to two months, Bitcoin will be at new highs,\u201d he said. Bitcoin is expected to climb to $150,000 to $200,000 over the next year, depending on who you ask. Of the more than $1 billion in liquidations in the past day, over $810 million came from long positions being wiped out, CoinGlass data showed. Bitcoin accounted for around $218 million of long liquidations. Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange automatically closes a trader\u2019s position when there isn\u2019t enough money to cover the losses, or what is known as margin. Open interest on Bitcoin futures contracts on Binance fell dramatically following the crash. Binance\u2019s most popular Bitcoin market, BTC/USD, saw open interest, or the number of outstanding futures contracts, fall by 8.5% to $5 billion, in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

Among its competitors are Fidelity Investments\u2019 Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund \u2014 which also set a daily volume record today \u2014 and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

The iShares fund has $10.7 billion in assets under management less than two months after its launch, making it the fastest-growing ETF ever.

            "body": " Grayscale\u2019s gambit with high management fees is beginning to look like a shrewd piece of business as Bitcoin set a fresh record high against the dollar. Even as the digital asset manager\u2019s flagship product, GBTC, has experienced an exodus of $9.2 billion since converting to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, its assets under management remain largely unchanged, clocking in at $28.4 billion as of Tuesday. \u201cWhile Grayscale is losing investors it has more assets than when it launched \u2014 a phenomenon we call the bull-market subsidy,\u201d Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told DL News. The same phenomenon occurs in other traditional financial products, like active mutual funds, he said. Despite years of \u201cbloodbath outflows\u201d the funds have more \u201cassets and revenue than ever simply because the market went up,\u201d Balchunas said. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s at play with GBTC. Bitcoin has rallied over 50% since January and set a record high above $69,100 on Tuesday. Despite Grayscale\u2019s challenges, the Bitcoin rally has enabled it to keep the value of GBTC\u2019s assets at an even keel. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s recent price surge has essentially offset the fund\u2019s massive outflows,\u201d Nate Geraci, president of financial advisory firm The ETFStore, told DL News. Since ETF fees are calculated and accrued daily Grayscale \u201chasn\u2019t lost any fee revenue if we assume a steady state in assets and the price of bitcoin moving forward,\u201d Geraci said. The firm\u2019s fee approach will likely continue \u201cruffling some feathers,\u201d but it looks like a \u201csavvy business move at this early juncture,\u201d Geraci said. It\u2019s possible Grayscale predicted spot Bitcoin ETF approval would \u201ccreate a new wave of demand,\u201d and push up the price of Bitcoin, Geraci said, \u201cif so, that looks smart right now.\u201d Based on GBTC\u2019s current assets under management of $28.4 billion, Grayscale\u2019s implied annual revenue is $420 million. Still, Grayscale faces pressure from all sides. Nine others ETFs, including ones run by Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, also launched on January 11. Rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s fees are 125 basis points lower than Grayscale at 0.25%. The Wall Street firms\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $11.5 billion and $7.5 billion in assets under management, respectively. That means both firms would make just under $30 million each from fee revenue in 2024, if on current assets and fees, not including fee promotions. Despite GBTC\u2019s market share falling to 55% from 100%, it\u2019s still leading on revenue. Grayscale did not return a request for comment from DL News.

            "headline": "Loving the Bitcoin rally? Thank Gary Gensler: \u2018We always thought the SEC was blind\u2019",
            "keypoints": "Bitcoin nears an all-time high anticipated by market watchers.\nExperts say this is thanks to regulators approving Bitcoin ETFs early this year.",
            "body": " The crypto industry is euphoric as Bitcoin\u2019s bull run has brought its price back to highs last reached in November 2021. And it\u2019s all thanks to Gary Gensler, experts say. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission chair gave the nod to 11 highly anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, the price of Bitcoin has been soaring. \u201cGensler should be really proud. This is a big achievement,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News. Balchunas said the ETFs have provided a safe and easy way for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. \u201cETFs rock! They\u2019re really good at what they do, especially compared to what was out there before them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy access, cheap, liquid, tax efficient. And they have a lot of safeguards in place; they\u2019re regulated and they have legal documents and risk disclosures attached to them.\u201d No wonder investors are piling in. Bitcoin has soared along with daily trading volume for BlackRock\u2019s new iShares Bitcoin Trust, which has smashed records and has crossed $10 billion in flows. It\u2019s nonetheless ironic that the industry has Gensler to thank for the ETFs, and therefore the rally, which has seen Bitcoin jump almost 40% this year and temporarily crossed $63,000 this week. The hard-charging chair\u2019s tenure has been marked by a crackdown on crypto businesses, with Gensler asserting repeatedly that the industry is rife with fraud and non-compliance. He made it clear in approving the ETFs that he was doing so only because told to by the courts. Gensler should have taken a victory lap after approving the ETFs, Balchunas said. \u201dETFs are a way to limit the audience that fraudsters and hucksters get.\u201d They\u2019re a win for consumer protection, which is after all the SEC\u2019s mandate. \u201cWe always thought the SEC was blind to the fact that the ETFs would help it achieve this goal,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that putting these ETFs out there and having by-the-book, legit companies running them with tons of compliance is a good way to limit the amount of damage that fraudsters and hucksters can do.\u201d It\u2019s likely that Gensler thought approving ETFs would legitimise Bitcoin and crypto more generally. \u2018It\u2019s not like they put heroin in an ETF.\u2019 The chair said SEC approval of the ETFs does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin itself, and that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d However, Balchunas noted, the SEC had already legitimised crypto. After all, investors could buy from Coinbase \u2014 a listed company \u2014 and the SEC had already approved Bitcoin futures products. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they put heroin in an ETF. You can get Bitcoin at exchanges that are publicly traded,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was already pretty legitimised, ETFs are just a better way to do it.\u201d Rebecca Rettig, chief legal and policy officer at Polygon Labs, told DL News that the current bull run is a result of a new image for Bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that there\u2019s acknowledgement that not just Bitcoin, but the industry is being taken more and more seriously,\u201d Rettig said. And, traditional financial markets are talking about Bitcoin\u2019s flight, thanks to ETFs, she said. Still, she said \u201ccrypto markets are evolving and nuanced, and so nothing is ever attributable to one thing alone.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s halving coming up in April is another potential price driver. The halving is programmed to occur once every four years to reduce the amount of new Bitcoin that can be created by miners. After the last halving, in 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared more than 600%. Have a tip? Reach out at joanna@dlnews.com and inbar@dlnews.com"

IBIT is the ticker symbol for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF. US-based Bitcoin ETFs set a new record for daily trading volumes on Wednesday, with more than $7.6 billion in activity, according to Bloomberg data. Wednesday\u2019s volume far exceeds the previous record of $4.6 billion record, set on January 11. Investment platforms like Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Merrill Lynch are currently mulling over whether or not to add spot Bitcoin ETFs, Balchunas said. A source close to UBS told DL News in January that only select clients were being given access to a limited number of Bitcoin ETFs. UBS advisors weren\u2019t allowed to solicit clients though, meaning only customers who specifically requested investments in these ETFs could get access. \u201cThey like to see track record and get paid off, but with grassroots demand like this they gonna have to expedite,\u201d he tweeted. Morgan Stanley is reportedly mulling the decision to add the ETFs to its brokerage platform, CoinDesk reported Wednesday. The investment bank did not immediately respond to request for comment from DL News. The surge in trading came as Bitcoin broke the $63,000 barrier on Wednesday, trading at levels not seen since late 2021. BlackRock\u2019s fund led the surge pack with more than $3.3 billion in volume, which translated to $612 million of inflows into the fund. Grayscale and Fidelity\u2019s ETFs reported volumes of approximately $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Despite the high volumes Grayscale\u2019s ETF clocked another day of outflows, with $216 million leaving the fund. Most market makers \u201csay this volume is largely [a] function of natural demand vs [algorithmic and arbitrage] type volume,\u201d Balchunas wrote. Arbitrage refers to a strategy deployed by traders to profit from price differences in similar assets. Simply put, they try to exploit price differences between markets, buying in one market where the price is lower and simultaneously selling in another where the price is higher, profiting on the discrepancy. Balchunas called the surge in trading volumes \u201cofficially a craze\u201d in a separate post earlier in the day. The analyst noted nine of the ETFs, excluding Grayscale, had already beaten a previous day-one record of $2.6 billion, halfway through Wednesday\u2019s trading session. \u201cThese numbers are absurd, highly rare stuff here,\u201d Balchunas wrote.

            "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
            "body": " In just a little over a year after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Bitcoin is surging to highs not seen since the frothy bull market more than two years ago. It\u2019s up 40% this year and crossed $63,000 on Wednesday morning. Some experts say that this rally will be different, and Bitcoin will soon surpass its record high of $69,000, reached in November 2021. The reason? The arrival of big players, including $10 trillion fund manager BlackRock. Such institutional investors will drive further rallies, says research firm Bernstein. \u201cBitcoin is on an 18-month path to $150,000, led by unprecedented institutional adoption,\u201d Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani said in a note to clients this week. Here\u2019s how institutions may give this rally staying power. The January approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and other finance giants has helped inject billions of inflows into the crypto markets. The ETFs are smashing records, bringing in daily inflows of up to $2.6 billion among the nine newcomers. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted a new reality in crypto \u2014 that spot ETFs drive Bitcoin activity. \u201cBlackRock is Godzilla-big,\u201d Balchunas wrote when asked why iShares had performed so well on the day, \u201cwith massive distribution, a trusted brand and they are well known in [the] trading world.\u201d Spot ETF inflows have also seen record-setting performance since the products\u2019 January 10 approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a Tuesday X post, BitMEX Research reported over $6 billion in net inflows across all ETFs. US Bitcoin ETFs have a current total value of $43 billion, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Balchunas views spot ETF performance as a sign of their relevance to Wall Street\u2019s biggest and most well-established assets. He noted that BlackRock\u2019s ETF is 11th among all ETFs and that it has cracked the top 25 among all stocks. According to Balchunas, BlackRock\u2019s \u201cnewbie ETF\u201d has achieved \u201cenough for (even big) institutional consideration.\u201d In a Monday report, crypto date firm Kaiko examined Bitcoin\u2019s weekend volume trends since 2018, and concluded that the share of Bitcoin trading on the weekend has declined, meaning more of the trading is taking place on weekdays. That\u2019s a sign of institutional involvement, Kaiko said. The share of Bitcoin traded on weekends \u201chas declined significantly over the past six years,\u201d dropping from 24% in 2018 to just 17% last year, the report said. Kaiko said that part of the reason for the growing gap is because trading has aligned with traditional finance players, most of which operate from Monday to Friday with limited after-hours trading. \u201cWeekend and overnight liquidity management has always been a challenge for 24/7 crypto markets, creating a mismatch between the operating hours of traditional financial institutions and the needs of large crypto traders and market makers,\u201d Kaiko wrote in its report. BTC weekend volume is in decline BTC weekend volume has largely declined since 2018. (Tyler Pearson/Kaiko) Kaiko also pointed to a rebound in Bitcoin liquidity since the January launch of several spot ETFs in the US drove up volumes. As volumes increasingly move away from the weekend and into regular business hours, the presence of institutions is clear. CoinGlass data shows Bitcoin\u2019s open interest-weighted funding rate skyrocketing to all-time highs on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts, topping levels seen ahead of the January ETF approval. Open interest reflects market participants\u2019 total outstanding futures contracts. Open interest reflects market participants\u2019 total outstanding futures contracts. Credit: CoinGlass (Tyler Pearson/CoinGlass) The institutionally driven Chicago Mercantile Exchange commands the biggest lead in open interest, at $7.8 billion \u2014 another indicator that big firms command the rally. The CME is considered a proxy for institutional interest in crypto as the exchange tends to attract those who seek more regulated platforms. High open interest shows more traders are entering into contracts, reflecting heightened demand for the contract\u2019s underlying asset. Earlier this week, DL News spoke to Le Shi, head of trading at market maker Auros, who explained that open interest \u201ccan serve as a valuable metric to assess short-term bullish sentiment\u201d in markets. CoinGlass data shows funding rates are also rising above levels seen before the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January. A high funding rate can indicate significant demand for long bets in the market.

            "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
            "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

Stablecoins \u201chave attracted the most capital, emphasising investors\u2019 inclination towards stability and reliability over other alternatives,\u201d Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They provide an avenue for traders to park their funds during highly volatile periods. \u201cStablecoins are an extremely crucial asset for traders both from a stability perspective and a leverage perspective,\u201d Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, told DL News. Stablecoins allow traders to manage and amplify their trading positions efficiently. By using stablecoins as collateral, traders can borrow additional funds to increase their investment size, potentially magnifying their profits or losses. They\u2019re also highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into other cryptocurrencies or used for transactions. Doyle pointed to the issuance of stablecoins as a measure of new capital flowing into the cryptocurrency market, which has topped $3.5 billion this year. That represents a growth of about 5% compared to the total market value of stablecoins seen at the start of 2024. Trade activity has so far pushed the total combined stablecoin market value to its highest peak since December 20, 2022, above $140 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Growth in the creation and distribution of stablecoins \u201cindicates confidence in the segment and shows new dollars onchain,\u201d Doyle said.
