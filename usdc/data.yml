overview: |
  USDC is a tokenized representation of the US Dollar (USD) supported by Circle. USDC aims to be an open,
  interoperable, safe, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. Each USDC is collateralized by corresponding
  USD held in cash or cash equivalents. These reserve assets are subject to monthly public reserve attestations
  conducted by Deloitte. Attestations and real-time stability metrics can be viewed here.

  - title: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
    value: |
      USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin. When users purchase USDC from Circle, the company will deposit the
      corresponding amount of US dollars in its bank account, and then issue the corresponding amount of USDC
      on the blockchain. <br />
      On the other hand, when users want to exchange USDC for US dollars, they can send USDC to Circle Company.
      The company will withdraw the corresponding amount of US dollars from its bank account for the user, and
      then destroy/burn the corresponding amount of USDC.

  - title: History
    value: |
      USDC was created by Centre, a consortium co-founded by Circle and Coinbase to develop price-stable cryptocurrencies.
      Centre and USDC were simultaneously announced in May 2018. USDC was officially introduced and launched on Sept. 26,
      2018, as an open, interoperable, safe, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. In August 2023, Centre was sunset as
      a stand-alone entity, and its responsibilities were fully transferred to Circle due to increased regulatory clarity
      and an attempt to streamline operations. Coinbase agreed to take an undisclosed equity stake in Circle and receive a
      portion of USDC reserve asset interest revenue. <br />
      Originally on Ethereum, USDC has expanded to offer native support (minted and burned) on an additional 14 networks.
      After an expansion to six new networks between September and October 2023, USDC is natively supported on Algorand,
      Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Flow, Hedera, NEAR, Cosmos via the Noble appchain, OP Mainnet, Polkadot via the Polkadot
      Asset Hub parachain, Polygon PoS, Solana, Stellar, and TRON. USDC also exists as a wrapped token bridged from
      Ethereum to networks such as BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, and zkSync, with Circle supporting a path to native support
      for networks that follow the Bridged USDC Standard. <br />
      First announced in September 2022, Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) went live on Ethereum and Avalanche in April
      2023. CCTP facilitates the transfer of native USDC across networks, reducing bridge and wrapped token risks associated
      with traditional “lock and mint” bridging methods. To use CCTP, users transfer native USDC on a supported source
      network to be burned. In return, an equivalent amount of native USDC is minted on a supported destination network and
      sent to the user’s specified beneficiary wallet address. CCTP supports transfers between Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum,
      OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon PoS, and Noble. <br />
      In August 2023, Circle launched the Programmable Wallets product, allowing developers to embed customized crypto wallets
      into applications. Developers can customize wallets by integrating USDC, opting for wallet infrastructure models such as
      developer-controlled wallets or user-controlled wallets, opting for wallet account types such as externally owned
      accounts (EOA) or smart contract accounts (SCA), etc. ****Since this launch, Circle has expanded its Web3 services
      offering by introducing features such as the following: <br />
      Postman Collection: Developers can test features and experiment with Programmable Wallets on testnets. <br />
      Smart Contract Platform: Developers can integrate and manage smart contracts to allow for app features such as
      decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, programmatic USDC transactions, NFTs, onchain loyalty programs, 
      CCTP integration, etc. <br />
      Gas Station: Developers can abstract away gas fees for end-users by sponsoring the fees. This ability can be subject
      to customized restrictions on the value of transactions, limits on gas used, etc. <br />
      After creating an account, developers can access Circle's Web3 services through the Web3 Services Console. Notably,
      these services are typically free up to a certain usage level. Once the free usage tier has been hit, developers must
      pay for additional usage of the product, with the price decreasing as usage grows to certain levels. <br />
      In September 2023, Circle launched its Circle Research arm to “accelerate and amplify technical innovation within
      crypto, blockchain, and Web3 through open-source research.” Its first contribution was releasing the open-source
      Perimeter Protocol, which allows developers to build USDC credit applications using the protocol's smart contracts
      for lending pools, loan constructs, and permissioning. Since then, Circle Research has continued to publish research
      related to Robust Thresholds ECDSA Signatures, Recoverable Wrapper Tokens, and R-Pools. <br />
      Occasionally, Circle releases backward-compatible updates to USDC. In November 2023, the first upgrade since early
      2021 was announced for a phased rollout through January 2024. The USDC v2.2 upgrade “significantly reduced gas costs,
      improved support for account abstraction, and further bolstered security for transactions on EVM blockchains.”

    value:
      - title: Regulatory Framework
        value: |
          MakerDAO operates in a decentralized manner, making it challenging to classify within traditional
          financial services regulatory frameworks in the UK and Europe. Its structure as a DAO and the way
          it facilitates transactions without acting as a lender in a traditional sense place it outside of
          many existing regulations that would apply to consumer credit providers or P2P lending platforms.
      - title: Licenses Obtained
        value: N.A.
      - title: AML/CFT Compliance KYC Procedures
        value: |
          The decentralized nature of MakerDAO complicates the application of typical Anti-Money Laundering
          (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.
          Traditional compliance mechanisms, like customer information collection, are not straightforwardly
          applicable to a system where lending and borrowing are mediated by smart contracts without a central authority.
      - title: Data Protection
        value: |
          * Blockchain Transparency: Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are transparent and immutable.
            This means once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a clear audit trail.
          * Anonymity and Pseudonymity: Users interact with the blockchain using addresses that do not directly
            reveal their real-world identities. However, this does not mean activities are entirely anonymous but pseudonymous, offering a level of privacy.
          * Smart Contract Security: MakerDAO's operations are managed by smart contracts, which are self-executing
            contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. While smart contracts are secure
            by design, their security heavily depends on the quality of the code. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts
            can potentially be exploited, highlighting the importance of rigorous code audits and security practices.
      - title: Consumer Protection Measures
        value: |
          * Decentralization and Governance: MakerDAO is governed by a decentralized community of MKR token holders who
            vote on changes to the protocol. This governance model allows for a democratic decision-making process, where
            changes aimed at protecting consumers or adjusting the system for better stability can be proposed and voted upon.
          * Collateralization and Liquidation Mechanisms: To mint DAI, users must over-collateralize, meaning they must
            deposit more value in Ethereum or other accepted assets than the amount of DAI they wish to generate. This mechanism
            protects against volatility. If the collateral's value falls below a certain threshold, it can be liquidated to
            ensure the system remains solvent, protecting the value of DAI.
          * Integration with External Platforms: Consumer protection on the user interface level, such as data privacy and
            transaction security, also depends on how third-party platforms integrating MakerDAO's protocols handle user data
            and security.
      - title: Reporting and Transparency
        value: |
          The open nature of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and the status of collateralized positions within
          MakerDAO and decision-making processes are publicly visible and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain. This provides
          a form of transparency and allows for independent audits, although the DAO itself does not follow traditional
          reporting mechanisms.

          The operation of MakerDAO relies on the principles of decentralization, with mechanisms such as automated trading bots (Keepers)
          to maintain DAI's peg to the dollar and manage the liquidation of collateral in a decentralized manner. These operational aspects
          are designed to ensure the protocol's stability and compliance with its internal rules without central oversight.

      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * DAI is created and managed by the MakerDAO protocol, which is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) running on the Ethereum
            blockchain. This protocol includes a series of smart contracts that manage the issuance and stability of DAI.
          * To mint DAI, users lock collateral, such as ETH or other supported assets, into a smart contract called a Vault (previously known as
            a Collateralized Debt Position or CDP). The user can then generate DAI against this collateral. The amount of DAI that can be minted
            is determined by the collateralization ratio, which ensures that there is always more value locked up than the amount of DAI in circulation.
          * DAI maintains its peg to the USD through external market mechanisms and internal economic incentives. For example, when the price of
            DAI is above $1, users are incentivized to pay back their DAI (which burns the token) and unlock their collateral, increasing the supply
            of DAI and pushing the price down. Conversely, when the price is below $1, users are encouraged to mint more DAI by opening new Vaults.
          * DAI represents a significant technological advancement in creating a decentralized, stable, and scalable currency. Its success has not only
            proven the concept of a stablecoin but also paved the way for more complex financial systems to be built on blockchain technology.

  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          MakerDAO's governance structure is decentralized, meaning it operates based on the collective decision-making of its token holders. The
          organization uses a DAO model, where decisions are made through proposals and voting to ensure democratic governance over its protocols
          and operations.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Voting rights within MakerDAO are granted to holders of its governance token, MKR. MKR token holders can propose changes, vote on various
          governance proposals, and have a say in the direction and management of the protocol. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of
          MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Token governance in MakerDAO revolves around the MKR token. MKR holders are responsible for governing the Maker Protocol, including
          risk management, collateral decisions, and the stability fee adjustments for DAI.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Proposals can be submitted by any MKR token holder. These proposals might range from changes to the system, updates to the protocol,
          or modifications to governance itself. There's usually a formal process for submission, including a discussion phase before a proposal
          goes to vote. https://vote.makerdao.com
      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          MakerDAO utilizes an on-chain voting mechanism, allowing MKR holders to vote directly on proposals. Votes are typically weighted by the
          amount of MKR a voter holds, ensuring that those with a larger stake in the protocol have a proportionally larger say.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          **DAI** <br />
          DAI does not have an initial allocation. <br />
          DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies. It maintains its peg to the US dollar through a system
          of smart contracts which automatically adjust the total supply of DAI to keep its price stable. When the price of DAI is above $1, the system
          encourages the creation of more DAI to bring the price down, which is done by decreasing the stability fee (interest rate) for creating DAI.
          Conversely, when the price of DAI is below $1, the system discourages the creation of more DAI to push the price up, which is done by increasing
          the stability fee. Therefore, the supply of DAI is not predetermined but is constantly changing in response to market conditions. You can find
          the latest amount on https://makerburn.com/#/charts

          **MKR** <br />
          The Initial token distribution of MKR is as follows:
          * 69.50% is allocated to Founders & Project
          * 15.00% is allocated to Team
          * 4.00% is allocated to Seed Round 1
          * 6.00% is allocated to Seed Round 2
          * 5.50% is allocated to Seed Round 3
          MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens during inception. The total number of MKR in existence can fluctuate based on how the system runs.
          When the Maker vault is liquidated, and the collateral auction and Maker Buffer of Dai are insufficient to repay the vault debt, the protocol will
          mint MKR (increasing the number of MKR in circulation), which will then be sold to Dai bidders. Conversely, if Dai's auction proceeds and stability
          fee payments exceed the Maker buffer limit (a figure set by Maker governance), they will sell excess Dai in exchange for MKR through a surplus auction.
          The Maker Protocol automatically destroys the collected MKR, thus reducing the total supply of MKR.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          MakerDAO's ecosystem includes diverse stakeholders, including MKR token holders, DAI users, developers, and integration partners.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Participation in governance is conducted on-chain, meaning that all votes and proposals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency
          and immutability of governance actions. Detailed analysis to be included.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          The MakerDAO system manages reserves through the collateralization of assets to mint DAI. The reserves are in the form of various cryptocurrencies submitted
          by users, managed by smart contracts to ensure solvency and stability of DAI.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          MakerDAO has mechanisms in place for emergency decision-making, known as Emergency Shutdown. This can be triggered if the system is under threat, safeguarding
          users' assets and the integrity of DAI.
      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          In the event of a significant change or fork in the protocol, governance decisions would guide the process, ensuring that stakeholders have a say in the
          direction and implementation of such changes.
      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          Compliance oversight potentially comes from the decentralized governance itself or through external advisories and audits.
      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          Accountability is built into the governance model through the visibility of all transactions and votes on the blockchain, along with community oversight and
          the possibility for stakeholders to propose changes if the system's integrity is at risk.
