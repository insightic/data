overview: |
  USDC is a tokenized representation of the US Dollar (USD) supported by Circle. USDC aims to be an open,
  interoperable, safe, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. Each USDC is collateralized by corresponding
  USD held in cash or cash equivalents. These reserve assets are subject to monthly public reserve attestations
  conducted by Deloitte. Attestations and real-time stability metrics can be viewed here.

  - title: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
    value: |
      USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin. When users purchase USDC from Circle, the company will deposit the
      corresponding amount of US dollars in its bank account, and then issue the corresponding amount of USDC
      on the blockchain. <br />
      On the other hand, when users want to exchange USDC for US dollars, they can send USDC to Circle Company.
      The company will withdraw the corresponding amount of US dollars from its bank account for the user, and
      then destroy/burn the corresponding amount of USDC.
  - title: Stability Mechanism

      1. When users purchase USDC from Circle, the company will deposit the corresponding amount of US dollars in
         its bank account, and then issue the corresponding amount of USDC on the blockchain.
      2. On the other hand, when users want to exchange USDC for US dollars, they can send USDC to Circle Company.
         The company will withdraw the corresponding amount of US dollars from its bank account for the user, and
         then destroy/burn the corresponding amount of USDC.

  - title: History
    value: |
      USDC was created by Centre, a consortium co-founded by Circle and Coinbase to develop price-stable cryptocurrencies.
      Centre and USDC were simultaneously announced in May 2018. USDC was officially introduced and launched on Sept. 26,
      2018, as an open, interoperable, safe, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. In August 2023, Centre was sunset as
      a stand-alone entity, and its responsibilities were fully transferred to Circle due to increased regulatory clarity
      and an attempt to streamline operations. Coinbase agreed to take an undisclosed equity stake in Circle and receive a
      portion of USDC reserve asset interest revenue. <br />
      Originally on Ethereum, USDC has expanded to offer native support (minted and burned) on an additional 14 networks.
      After an expansion to six new networks between September and October 2023, USDC is natively supported on Algorand,
      Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Flow, Hedera, NEAR, Cosmos via the Noble appchain, OP Mainnet, Polkadot via the Polkadot
      Asset Hub parachain, Polygon PoS, Solana, Stellar, and TRON. USDC also exists as a wrapped token bridged from
      Ethereum to networks such as BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, and zkSync, with Circle supporting a path to native support
      for networks that follow the Bridged USDC Standard. <br />
      First announced in September 2022, Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) went live on Ethereum and Avalanche in April
      2023. CCTP facilitates the transfer of native USDC across networks, reducing bridge and wrapped token risks associated
      with traditional “lock and mint” bridging methods. To use CCTP, users transfer native USDC on a supported source
      network to be burned. In return, an equivalent amount of native USDC is minted on a supported destination network and
      sent to the user's specified beneficiary wallet address. CCTP supports transfers between Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum,
      OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon PoS, and Noble. <br />
      In August 2023, Circle launched the Programmable Wallets product, allowing developers to embed customized crypto wallets
      into applications. Developers can customize wallets by integrating USDC, opting for wallet infrastructure models such as
      developer-controlled wallets or user-controlled wallets, opting for wallet account types such as externally owned
      accounts (EOA) or smart contract accounts (SCA), etc. ****Since this launch, Circle has expanded its Web3 services
      offering by introducing features such as the following: <br />
      Postman Collection: Developers can test features and experiment with Programmable Wallets on testnets. <br />
      Smart Contract Platform: Developers can integrate and manage smart contracts to allow for app features such as
      decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, programmatic USDC transactions, NFTs, onchain loyalty programs, 
      CCTP integration, etc. <br />
      Gas Station: Developers can abstract away gas fees for end-users by sponsoring the fees. This ability can be subject
      to customized restrictions on the value of transactions, limits on gas used, etc. <br />
      After creating an account, developers can access Circle's Web3 services through the Web3 Services Console. Notably,
      these services are typically free up to a certain usage level. Once the free usage tier has been hit, developers must
      pay for additional usage of the product, with the price decreasing as usage grows to certain levels. <br />
      In September 2023, Circle launched its Circle Research arm to “accelerate and amplify technical innovation within
      crypto, blockchain, and Web3 through open-source research.” Its first contribution was releasing the open-source
      Perimeter Protocol, which allows developers to build USDC credit applications using the protocol's smart contracts
      for lending pools, loan constructs, and permissioning. Since then, Circle Research has continued to publish research
      related to Robust Thresholds ECDSA Signatures, Recoverable Wrapper Tokens, and R-Pools. <br />
      Occasionally, Circle releases backward-compatible updates to USDC. In November 2023, the first upgrade since early
      2021 was announced for a phased rollout through January 2024. The USDC v2.2 upgrade “significantly reduced gas costs,
      improved support for account abstraction, and further bolstered security for transactions on EVM blockchains.”

          * USDC Token: USD Coin (USDC) is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value
            as opposed to the high volatility observed in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. USDC, in particular, aims to maintain
            a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
