overview: |
  Tether is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin offering individuals the advantage of transacting on blockchains while
  mitigating price risk. Tether offers five stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies and commodities: USDT
  (US Dollar), EURT (Euro), CNHT (Chinese Yuan), MXNT (Mexican Peso), and XAUT (gold). Tether's FAQ states, “All
  Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., one USDT = one USD) and are backed 100%
  by Tether's reserves.”

      The primary purpose of USDT is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like
      Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have prices that fluctuate wildly, one USDT token is designed to remain exactly equal to
      one USD. This is achieved by maintaining a reserve of real-world assets, including cash and equivalents, which back
      each token issued.

      1. USDT Token: USDT is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Its value is meant to mirror that of the US
      dollar (USD) on a 1:1 basis. USDT operates on multiple blockchains through a process called 'multichain support', so
      that can leverage the security and features of these networks, such as smart contract capabilities, fast transactions,
      and broad interoperability. Tether claims each USDT unit issued is backed by a US dollar held in reserve.

  - title: History
    value: |
      Founded in July 2014 by Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars, and Reeve Collins, Tether (USDT), originally known as "Realcoin,"
      is a stablecoin that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the US Dollar (USD). Tether was one of the first
      stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept
      in 2012. The first tokens were issued on Omni in October 2014, with the project rebranding to “Tether” in November 2014.
      Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model and is the most widely transacted stablecoin. <br />
      In January 2015, Bitfinex became the first platform to enable trading of USDT. <br />
      In November 2017, Tether was hacked, in which the “Tether Treasury” wallet address was drained of ~$30.95 million in USDT
      tokens. While these funds were not recovered, the project team marked these stolen tokens as “unredeemable.” <br />
      In 2018, Bitfinex, facing an alleged $850.00 million loss due to Crypto Capital's actions, secured a line of credit from
      Tether. This loan was scrutinized by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) since Tether's reserves, believed to fully
      back USDT, were used. In April 2019, the NYAG revealed conflicting transactions between Bitfinex and Tether in an alleged
      attempt to cover the loss. By 2021, Bitfinex claimed that it had repaid the loan; however, the NYAG found that Bitfinex and
      Tether made additional false statements to conceal the losses, ultimately leading to financial arrangements between the two
      to cover the losses. Tether and Bitfinex settled with the NYAG in February 2021, agreeing to pay an $18.50 million fine,
      ceasing trading activity with residents of New York (United States), and implementing “a number of steps to increase
      transparency.” Of note, a Tether blog post states, “Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing.” <br />
      In October 2021, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an order filing and settling charges
      against Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Limited, Tether Operations Limited, and Tether International Limited “for making untrue
      or misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the U.S. dollar tether token (USDT) stablecoin.
      The order requires Tether to pay a civil monetary penalty of $41.00 million and cease and desist from further violations of the
      Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.” Additional case background information can be seen here. <br />
      In October 2023, long-time CTO Paolo Ardoino was appointed as CEO of Tether, succeeding Jean-Louis van der Velde. According
      to the announcement, Ardoino's CEO duties would begin in December 2023.

          * Tether issues new USDT tokens based on demand. When a user or an entity wants to acquire USDT, they can send USD to Tether's bank account,
          and Tether will issue an equivalent amount of USDT to the user's blockchain address. Conversely, USDT can be 'redeemed' or 'destroyed' when the
          equivalent amount of USD is withdrawn from the reserve, and the corresponding USDT is taken out of circulation.

  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          MakerDAO's governance structure is decentralized, meaning it operates based on the collective decision-making of its token holders. The
          organization uses a DAO model, where decisions are made through proposals and voting to ensure democratic governance over its protocols
          and operations.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Voting rights within MakerDAO are granted to holders of its governance token, MKR. MKR token holders can propose changes, vote on various
          governance proposals, and have a say in the direction and management of the protocol. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of
          MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Token governance in MakerDAO revolves around the MKR token. MKR holders are responsible for governing the Maker Protocol, including
          risk management, collateral decisions, and the stability fee adjustments for DAI.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Proposals can be submitted by any MKR token holder. These proposals might range from changes to the system, updates to the protocol,
          or modifications to governance itself. There's usually a formal process for submission, including a discussion phase before a proposal
          goes to vote. https://vote.makerdao.com
      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          MakerDAO utilizes an on-chain voting mechanism, allowing MKR holders to vote directly on proposals. Votes are typically weighted by the
          amount of MKR a voter holds, ensuring that those with a larger stake in the protocol have a proportionally larger say.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          **DAI** <br />
          DAI does not have an initial allocation. <br />
          DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies. It maintains its peg to the US dollar through a system
          of smart contracts which automatically adjust the total supply of DAI to keep its price stable. When the price of DAI is above $1, the system
          encourages the creation of more DAI to bring the price down, which is done by decreasing the stability fee (interest rate) for creating DAI.
          Conversely, when the price of DAI is below $1, the system discourages the creation of more DAI to push the price up, which is done by increasing
          the stability fee. Therefore, the supply of DAI is not predetermined but is constantly changing in response to market conditions. You can find
          the latest amount on https://makerburn.com/#/charts

          **MKR** <br />
          The Initial token distribution of MKR is as follows:
          * 69.50% is allocated to Founders & Project
          * 15.00% is allocated to Team
          * 4.00% is allocated to Seed Round 1
          * 6.00% is allocated to Seed Round 2
          * 5.50% is allocated to Seed Round 3
          MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens during inception. The total number of MKR in existence can fluctuate based on how the system runs.
          When the Maker vault is liquidated, and the collateral auction and Maker Buffer of Dai are insufficient to repay the vault debt, the protocol will
          mint MKR (increasing the number of MKR in circulation), which will then be sold to Dai bidders. Conversely, if Dai's auction proceeds and stability
          fee payments exceed the Maker buffer limit (a figure set by Maker governance), they will sell excess Dai in exchange for MKR through a surplus auction.
          The Maker Protocol automatically destroys the collected MKR, thus reducing the total supply of MKR.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          MakerDAO's ecosystem includes diverse stakeholders, including MKR token holders, DAI users, developers, and integration partners.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Participation in governance is conducted on-chain, meaning that all votes and proposals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency
          and immutability of governance actions. Detailed analysis to be included.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          The MakerDAO system manages reserves through the collateralization of assets to mint DAI. The reserves are in the form of various cryptocurrencies submitted
          by users, managed by smart contracts to ensure solvency and stability of DAI.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          MakerDAO has mechanisms in place for emergency decision-making, known as Emergency Shutdown. This can be triggered if the system is under threat, safeguarding
          users' assets and the integrity of DAI.
      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          In the event of a significant change or fork in the protocol, governance decisions would guide the process, ensuring that stakeholders have a say in the
          direction and implementation of such changes.
      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          Compliance oversight potentially comes from the decentralized governance itself or through external advisories and audits.
      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          Accountability is built into the governance model through the visibility of all transactions and votes on the blockchain, along with community oversight and
          the possibility for stakeholders to propose changes if the system's integrity is at risk.
