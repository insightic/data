overview: |
  Tether is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin offering individuals the advantage of transacting on blockchains while
  mitigating price risk. Tether offers five stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies and commodities: USDT
  (US Dollar), EURT (Euro), CNHT (Chinese Yuan), MXNT (Mexican Peso), and XAUT (gold). Tether's FAQ states, “All
  Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., one USDT = one USD) and are backed 100%
  by Tether's reserves.”

      The primary purpose of USDT is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like
      Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have prices that fluctuate wildly, one USDT token is designed to remain exactly equal to
      one USD. This is achieved by maintaining a reserve of real-world assets, including cash and equivalents, which back
      each token issued.

      1. USDT Token: USDT is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Its value is meant to mirror that of the US
      dollar (USD) on a 1:1 basis. USDT operates on multiple blockchains through a process called 'multichain support', so
      that can leverage the security and features of these networks, such as smart contract capabilities, fast transactions,
      and broad interoperability. Tether claims each USDT unit issued is backed by a US dollar held in reserve.

  - title: History
    value: |
      Founded in July 2014 by Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars, and Reeve Collins, Tether (USDT), originally known as "Realcoin,"
      is a stablecoin that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the US Dollar (USD). Tether was one of the first
      stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept
      in 2012. The first tokens were issued on Omni in October 2014, with the project rebranding to “Tether” in November 2014.
      Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model and is the most widely transacted stablecoin. <br />
      In January 2015, Bitfinex became the first platform to enable trading of USDT. <br />
      In November 2017, Tether was hacked, in which the “Tether Treasury” wallet address was drained of ~$30.95 million in USDT
      tokens. While these funds were not recovered, the project team marked these stolen tokens as “unredeemable.” <br />
      In 2018, Bitfinex, facing an alleged $850.00 million loss due to Crypto Capital's actions, secured a line of credit from
      Tether. This loan was scrutinized by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) since Tether's reserves, believed to fully
      back USDT, were used. In April 2019, the NYAG revealed conflicting transactions between Bitfinex and Tether in an alleged
      attempt to cover the loss. By 2021, Bitfinex claimed that it had repaid the loan; however, the NYAG found that Bitfinex and
      Tether made additional false statements to conceal the losses, ultimately leading to financial arrangements between the two
      to cover the losses. Tether and Bitfinex settled with the NYAG in February 2021, agreeing to pay an $18.50 million fine,
      ceasing trading activity with residents of New York (United States), and implementing “a number of steps to increase
      transparency.” Of note, a Tether blog post states, “Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing.” <br />
      In October 2021, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an order filing and settling charges
      against Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Limited, Tether Operations Limited, and Tether International Limited “for making untrue
      or misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the U.S. dollar tether token (USDT) stablecoin.
      The order requires Tether to pay a civil monetary penalty of $41.00 million and cease and desist from further violations of the
      Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.” Additional case background information can be seen here. <br />
      In October 2023, long-time CTO Paolo Ardoino was appointed as CEO of Tether, succeeding Jean-Louis van der Velde. According
      to the announcement, Ardoino's CEO duties would begin in December 2023.

          * USDT Token: USDT is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Its value is meant to mirror that of the US dollar (USD) on a 1:1 basis.
            USDT operates on multiple blockchains through a process called 'multichain support', so that can leverage the security and features of

            backed by a US dollar held in reserve.
          * Tether issues new USDT tokens based on demand. When a user or an entity wants to acquire USDT, they can send USD to Tether's bank account,
          and Tether will issue an equivalent amount of USDT to the user's blockchain address. Conversely, USDT can be 'redeemed' or 'destroyed' when the
          equivalent amount of USD is withdrawn from the reserve, and the corresponding USDT is taken out of circulation.
