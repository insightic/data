overview: |
  Tether is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin offering individuals the advantage of transacting on blockchains while
  mitigating price risk. Tether offers five stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies and commodities: USDT
  (US Dollar), EURT (Euro), CNHT (Chinese Yuan), MXNT (Mexican Peso), and XAUT (gold). Tether's FAQ states, “All
  Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency (e.g., one USDT = one USD) and are backed 100%
  by Tether's reserves.”

      The primary purpose of USDT is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like
      Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have prices that fluctuate wildly, one USDT token is designed to remain exactly equal to
      one USD. This is achieved by maintaining a reserve of real-world assets, including cash and equivalents, which back
      each token issued.
  - title: Stability Mechanism
    value: |
      1. USDT Token: USDT is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Its value is meant to mirror that of the US
      dollar (USD) on a 1:1 basis. USDT operates on multiple blockchains through a process called 'multichain support', so
      that can leverage the security and features of these networks, such as smart contract capabilities, fast transactions,
      and broad interoperability. Tether claims each USDT unit issued is backed by a US dollar held in reserve.

  - title: History
    value: |
      Founded in July 2014 by Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars, and Reeve Collins, Tether (USDT), originally known as "Realcoin,"
      is a stablecoin that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the US Dollar (USD). Tether was one of the first
      stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept
      in 2012. The first tokens were issued on Omni in October 2014, with the project rebranding to “Tether” in November 2014.
      Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model and is the most widely transacted stablecoin. <br />
      In January 2015, Bitfinex became the first platform to enable trading of USDT. <br />
      In November 2017, Tether was hacked, in which the “Tether Treasury” wallet address was drained of ~$30.95 million in USDT
      tokens. While these funds were not recovered, the project team marked these stolen tokens as “unredeemable.” <br />
      In 2018, Bitfinex, facing an alleged $850.00 million loss due to Crypto Capital's actions, secured a line of credit from
      Tether. This loan was scrutinized by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) since Tether's reserves, believed to fully
      back USDT, were used. In April 2019, the NYAG revealed conflicting transactions between Bitfinex and Tether in an alleged
      attempt to cover the loss. By 2021, Bitfinex claimed that it had repaid the loan; however, the NYAG found that Bitfinex and
      Tether made additional false statements to conceal the losses, ultimately leading to financial arrangements between the two
      to cover the losses. Tether and Bitfinex settled with the NYAG in February 2021, agreeing to pay an $18.50 million fine,
      ceasing trading activity with residents of New York (United States), and implementing “a number of steps to increase
      transparency.” Of note, a Tether blog post states, “Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing.” <br />
      In October 2021, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an order filing and settling charges
      against Tether Holdings Limited, Tether Limited, Tether Operations Limited, and Tether International Limited “for making untrue
      or misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the U.S. dollar tether token (USDT) stablecoin.
      The order requires Tether to pay a civil monetary penalty of $41.00 million and cease and desist from further violations of the
      Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.” Additional case background information can be seen here. <br />
      In October 2023, long-time CTO Paolo Ardoino was appointed as CEO of Tether, succeeding Jean-Louis van der Velde. According
      to the announcement, Ardoino's CEO duties would begin in December 2023.

    value:
      - title: Regulatory Framework
        value: |
          MakerDAO operates in a decentralized manner, making it challenging to classify within traditional
          financial services regulatory frameworks in the UK and Europe. Its structure as a DAO and the way
          it facilitates transactions without acting as a lender in a traditional sense place it outside of
          many existing regulations that would apply to consumer credit providers or P2P lending platforms.
      - title: Licenses Obtained
        value: N.A.
      - title: AML/CFT Compliance KYC Procedures
        value: |
          The decentralized nature of MakerDAO complicates the application of typical Anti-Money Laundering
          (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.
          Traditional compliance mechanisms, like customer information collection, are not straightforwardly
          applicable to a system where lending and borrowing are mediated by smart contracts without a central authority.
      - title: Data Protection
        value: |
          * Blockchain Transparency: Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are transparent and immutable.
            This means once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a clear audit trail.
          * Anonymity and Pseudonymity: Users interact with the blockchain using addresses that do not directly
            reveal their real-world identities. However, this does not mean activities are entirely anonymous but pseudonymous, offering a level of privacy.
          * Smart Contract Security: MakerDAO's operations are managed by smart contracts, which are self-executing
            contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. While smart contracts are secure
            by design, their security heavily depends on the quality of the code. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts
            can potentially be exploited, highlighting the importance of rigorous code audits and security practices.
      - title: Consumer Protection Measures
        value: |
          * Decentralization and Governance: MakerDAO is governed by a decentralized community of MKR token holders who
            vote on changes to the protocol. This governance model allows for a democratic decision-making process, where
            changes aimed at protecting consumers or adjusting the system for better stability can be proposed and voted upon.
          * Collateralization and Liquidation Mechanisms: To mint DAI, users must over-collateralize, meaning they must
            deposit more value in Ethereum or other accepted assets than the amount of DAI they wish to generate. This mechanism
            protects against volatility. If the collateral's value falls below a certain threshold, it can be liquidated to
            ensure the system remains solvent, protecting the value of DAI.
          * Integration with External Platforms: Consumer protection on the user interface level, such as data privacy and
            transaction security, also depends on how third-party platforms integrating MakerDAO's protocols handle user data
            and security.
      - title: Reporting and Transparency
        value: |
          The open nature of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and the status of collateralized positions within
          MakerDAO and decision-making processes are publicly visible and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain. This provides
          a form of transparency and allows for independent audits, although the DAO itself does not follow traditional
          reporting mechanisms.

          to maintain DAI's peg to the dollar and manage the liquidation of collateral in a decentralized manner. These operational aspects
          are designed to ensure the protocol's stability and compliance with its internal rules without central oversight.

      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * DAI is created and managed by the MakerDAO protocol, which is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) running on the Ethereum
            blockchain. This protocol includes a series of smart contracts that manage the issuance and stability of DAI.
          * To mint DAI, users lock collateral, such as ETH or other supported assets, into a smart contract called a Vault (previously known as
            a Collateralized Debt Position or CDP). The user can then generate DAI against this collateral. The amount of DAI that can be minted
            is determined by the collateralization ratio, which ensures that there is always more value locked up than the amount of DAI in circulation.
          * DAI maintains its peg to the USD through external market mechanisms and internal economic incentives. For example, when the price of
            DAI is above $1, users are incentivized to pay back their DAI (which burns the token) and unlock their collateral, increasing the supply
            of DAI and pushing the price down. Conversely, when the price is below $1, users are encouraged to mint more DAI by opening new Vaults.
          * DAI represents a significant technological advancement in creating a decentralized, stable, and scalable currency. Its success has not only
            proven the concept of a stablecoin but also paved the way for more complex financial systems to be built on blockchain technology.

  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          MakerDAO's governance structure is decentralized, meaning it operates based on the collective decision-making of its token holders. The
          organization uses a DAO model, where decisions are made through proposals and voting to ensure democratic governance over its protocols
          and operations.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Voting rights within MakerDAO are granted to holders of its governance token, MKR. MKR token holders can propose changes, vote on various
          governance proposals, and have a say in the direction and management of the protocol. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of
          MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Token governance in MakerDAO revolves around the MKR token. MKR holders are responsible for governing the Maker Protocol, including
          risk management, collateral decisions, and the stability fee adjustments for DAI.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Proposals can be submitted by any MKR token holder. These proposals might range from changes to the system, updates to the protocol,
          or modifications to governance itself. There's usually a formal process for submission, including a discussion phase before a proposal
          goes to vote. https://vote.makerdao.com
      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          MakerDAO utilizes an on-chain voting mechanism, allowing MKR holders to vote directly on proposals. Votes are typically weighted by the
          amount of MKR a voter holds, ensuring that those with a larger stake in the protocol have a proportionally larger say.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          **DAI** <br />
          DAI does not have an initial allocation. <br />
          DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies. It maintains its peg to the US dollar through a system
          of smart contracts which automatically adjust the total supply of DAI to keep its price stable. When the price of DAI is above $1, the system
          encourages the creation of more DAI to bring the price down, which is done by decreasing the stability fee (interest rate) for creating DAI.
          Conversely, when the price of DAI is below $1, the system discourages the creation of more DAI to push the price up, which is done by increasing
          the stability fee. Therefore, the supply of DAI is not predetermined but is constantly changing in response to market conditions. You can find
          the latest amount on https://makerburn.com/#/charts

          **MKR** <br />
          The Initial token distribution of MKR is as follows:
          * 69.50% is allocated to Founders & Project
          * 15.00% is allocated to Team
          * 4.00% is allocated to Seed Round 1
          * 6.00% is allocated to Seed Round 2
          * 5.50% is allocated to Seed Round 3
          MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens during inception. The total number of MKR in existence can fluctuate based on how the system runs.
          When the Maker vault is liquidated, and the collateral auction and Maker Buffer of Dai are insufficient to repay the vault debt, the protocol will
          mint MKR (increasing the number of MKR in circulation), which will then be sold to Dai bidders. Conversely, if Dai's auction proceeds and stability
          fee payments exceed the Maker buffer limit (a figure set by Maker governance), they will sell excess Dai in exchange for MKR through a surplus auction.
          The Maker Protocol automatically destroys the collected MKR, thus reducing the total supply of MKR.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          MakerDAO's ecosystem includes diverse stakeholders, including MKR token holders, DAI users, developers, and integration partners.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Participation in governance is conducted on-chain, meaning that all votes and proposals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency
          and immutability of governance actions. Detailed analysis to be included.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          The MakerDAO system manages reserves through the collateralization of assets to mint DAI. The reserves are in the form of various cryptocurrencies submitted
          by users, managed by smart contracts to ensure solvency and stability of DAI.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          MakerDAO has mechanisms in place for emergency decision-making, known as Emergency Shutdown. This can be triggered if the system is under threat, safeguarding
