overview: |
  USDD is an over-collateralized stablecoin that is issued by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR), which is also the custodian. The TDR is made up of nine crypto-native institutions. USDD’s value is backed by the over-collateralization of crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The peg is maintained through the Peg Stability Module (PSM) that allows 1:1 transfer of USDD for USDT, USDC, TUSD, and USDJ. The PSM’s USDD funding is controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. USDD can be minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TDR by depositing TRX.

    value: |
      The peg is maintained through the Peg Stability Module (PSM) that allows 1:1 transfer of USDD for USDT, USDC, TUSD, and USDJ. The PSM’s USDD funding is controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. USDD can be minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TDR by depositing TRX.There are smart contracts which automatically adjust the total supply of USDD to keep its price stable. When the price of USDD is above $1, the system encourages the creation of more USDD to bring the price down. This is done by decreasing the stability fee (interest rate) for creating USDD. Conversely, when the price of USDD is below $1, the system discourages the creation of more USDD to push the price up. This is done by increasing the stability fee.

      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * USDD is minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR) through burning TRX. Its value is backed by the over-collateralization of highly liquid crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The circulation and use of USDD are free from the intervention of any centralized parties. Similar to BTC and ETH, USDD grants its holders full ownership, meaning that no organization or individual has access to freeze users’ USDD.
  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          USDD is governed by the TRON DAO Reserve, emphasizing decentralized governance with the backing of multiple high-quality assets for over-collateralization.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Not specifically mentioned; the governance structure implies decision-making through the TRON DAO Reserve, which is likely more centralized with input from members.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Managed by the TRON DAO Reserve, with decisions likely influenced by TRON's ecosystem and its participants.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Not detailed; operational decisions and proposals are presumably managed internally within the TRON DAO Reserve.

      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          Not explicitly mentioned; governance appears to be centralized within the TRON DAO Reserve without a public voting mechanism.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          USDD is over-collateralized with assets including BTC, TRX, USDT, among others, ensuring stability. It operates on multiple blockchains, including TRON, Ethereum, and BNB Chain, with support for additional chains.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          Stakeholders include TRON DAO Reserve members, TRON network users, and potentially the wider blockchain community through interoperability with other chains.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Not applicable as detailed governance mechanisms are not provided; governance is likely off-chain through the TRON DAO Reserve.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          The TRON DAO Reserve manages the reserves, ensuring over-collateralization with a transparent and publicly available collateral ratio, significantly higher than the issuance of USDD.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          Not explicitly covered, but the TRON DAO Reserve employs various monetary policies to maintain stability, including interest rate adjustments and open market operations.
      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          Not applicable or not mentioned; focus is on stablecoin issuance and reserve management rather than blockchain infrastructure decisions.
      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          The TRON DAO Reserve operates with a commitment to transparency and stability, with real-time collateral ratios and reserve assets publicly disclosed.
      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          Includes public disclosure of the collateral ratio and reserve assets, with real-time information available on the TRON DAO Reserve website, enhancing transparency and trust in the stablecoin's backing and stability.
