    "biz_content": "Stablecoin is the token issued by FD121 LIMITED. It is an upgradeable ERC20 token which the owner can mint and burn tokens, pause the contract and freeze specific user actions.\n\nThe audited Stablecoin token's basic information is as follows:\n- Name: FD121 LIMITED\n- Type: ERC20 Token Contract\n- Platform: Solidity\n- Audit Method: Whitebox\n- Audit Completion Date: May 10, 2023\n\nThe Git repository of the reviewed files and the commit hash value used in this audit is: https://github.com/FD-121/fd-stablecoin/blob/main/src/Stablecoin.sol (ec35f7c)\n\nMoreover, the ERC20 compliance checks confirm no inconsistency or incompatibility issue with the audited Stablecoin Contract. The token contract is outlined to include basic view-only functions and key state-changing functions defined in the ERC20 specification. Additional opt-in features examined include Deflationary, Rebasing, Pausable, Blacklistable, Mintable, and Burnable aspects.\n\nIn the detailed results section, a Trust Issue of Admin Keys (ID: PVE-001) with a medium severity was identified. It discusses the privileged role of the owner account in the contract, which includes the power to mint tokens, burn tokens, blacklist an address, and pause token transfers and other operations. The account needs scrutiny, and it is suggested to transfer the privileges to a community-governed DAO or ensure the privileges are managed by a multi-sig account. The issue has been mitigated with the team confirming that a multi-sig account will be used.\n\n",
