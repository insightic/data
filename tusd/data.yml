  - title: Type of Stablecoin
    value: |
      Asset-backed Stablecoins:TrueUSD(TUSD) is the first digital asset with live on-chain attestations by independent third-party institutions and is backed 1:1 with the U.S. dollar (USD).

  - title: Stability Mechanism

With the integration of Chainlink PoR, TrueUSD becomes the first USD-Backed stablecoin to secure minting and further ensure transparency

  - title: History
    value: |
      Seeing the issues surrounding whether or not Tether was fully backed and had reliable banking relationships, Trust Token decided to created a stablecoin called TrueUSD (TUSD). Introduced mid 2018, TrueUSD is a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by U.S. Dollars, launched via the Trust Token platform as the platform's continued effort to tokenize real-world assets on their collateralized platform. Each TUSD token is backed by one dollar and was launched and distributed via a Trust Token platform smart contract. Trust Token has partnered with registered fiduciaries and banks that hold the assets backing the TUSD tokens.
      In December 2019, TrueUSD became the first stablecoin to offer real time audits.

  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          TUSD utilizes smart contracts for minting and redemption, ensuring real-time on-chain verification of reserves. It's supported by Moore Hong Kong and Chainlink Proof of Reserve for enhanced transparency and trust​​.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Not explicitly mentioned, suggesting a centralized governance structure with operational decisions likely managed by the issuing entity and verified by independent third parties for transparency​​​​.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Managed centrally with a focus on transparency and security. TUSD's operations include live on-chain attestations of reserves by independent accounting firms, enhancing its credibility​​.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Not detailed; governance and operational changes are presumably managed internally with oversight by independent auditors and compliance with blockchain verification mechanisms like Chainlink Proof of Reserve​​.
      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          Not applicable or not mentioned, indicating a lack of a decentralized governance model where token holders vote on proposals or changes.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          TUSD tokens are minted upon deposit of USD to a designated bank account, with each token fully backed by USD reserves. Users can mint or redeem TUSD through the official platform without fees, with the platform earning through the interest on USD held in reserves​​.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          Stakeholders include the TUSD issuing entity, users (both individual and corporate), and independent third-party auditors. TUSD's ecosystem spans multiple blockchain networks, enhancing its accessibility and utility across various platforms​​.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Not mentioned, with the governance model focusing on reserve transparency and security rather than participatory governance or decision-making by token holders or a decentralized community​​​​.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          Reserves are fully backed by U.S. dollars and equivalents, with real-time attestations and proof of reserves provided by independent auditors and Chainlink's blockchain technology. This ensures that the total supply of TUSD does not exceed the U.S. dollars held in reserve​​.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          Not specifically mentioned; however, the integration of Chainlink Proof of Reserve for automated minting control suggests a proactive approach to managing reserve adequacy and token issuance transparency​​.
      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          Not applicable or not discussed directly, though TUSD's blockchain-agnostic approach and smart contract operations imply a focus on interoperability and adaptability across multiple blockchain networks​​.
      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          TUSD emphasizes regulatory compliance and transparency, with reserves verified by independent, third-party auditors and real-time on-chain reserve attestations. It operates under a U.S.-based accounting firm and has engaged Moore Hong Kong for daily attestation services, reflecting a commitment to high transparency standards​​​​.
      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          Features real-time reserve attestations and transparent, publicly accessible audit results. TUSD's collaboration with Moore Hong Kong for daily attestation services starting in late January 2024 exemplifies its dedication to transparency and accountability in the stablecoin ecosystem​​.
