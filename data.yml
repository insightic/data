overview:
  overview: |
    Maker is a self-described “Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD)” lending protocol designed “to bring stability to the
    cryptocurrency economy.” To achieve this, Maker employs a two-token strategy - MKR and DAI. MKR is the protocol's
    governance token used to vote on various aspects of the protocol, such as technical upgrades, risk parameters, and
    collateral types. In contrast, DAI is the protocol's collateral-backed stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar (USD).
    Minting DAI via Maker entails over-collateralizing a loan with assets approved by MakerDAO via the protocol's
    governance mechanism.
  type of stablecoin: |
    DAI is a crypto-collateralized stablecoin created by the MakerDAO system on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Unlike fiat or commodity-collateralized stablecoins, DAI maintains its dollar-peg through a mix of
    other cryptocurrencies used as collateral. Users generate DAI by locking these assets into a smart
    contract, ensuring the stablecoin is over-collateralized to handle asset volatility. Automated mechanisms
    liquidate the collateral if its value drops too low, maintaining DAI's stability. This method distinguishes
    DAI from other types of stablecoins.
  stability mechanism: |
    1. Over-Collateralization: DAI it backed by other cryptocurrencies. Users must lock up more value in
       collateral than the amount of DAI they wish to mint, creating a buffer against the volatility of
       the collateral assets.
    2. Liquidation Process: If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold (due to price
       movements in the crypto market), the MakerDAO system automatically initiates a liquidation process.
       This involves selling the collateral in an open market auction for DAI to reduce the circulating supply of
       DAI and ensure that each DAI remains adequately backed by collateral.
  backing assets: |
    1. Ethereum (ETH): ETH was the first and primary collateral type used to mint DAI. It remains a significant part
       of the collateral pool due to its liquidity and market presence.
    2. Real-World Assets (RWAs): MakerDAO has also explored using real-world assets as collateral. This involves
       tokenized versions of physical or traditional financial assets, expanding the possibilities for DAI collateral
       beyond digital assets alone.
    3. USDC and other Stablecoins: Other stablecoins like USDC have been added as collateral options to provide more
       stability and flexibility in the types of collateral that can be used.
    4. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): WBTC allows Bitcoin holders to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. It's used as
       collateral due to its value and stability as a digital representation of Bitcoin.
    5. Other ERC-20 Tokens: A variety of other ERC-20 tokens approved by MakerDAO governance can be used as collateral.
       These include tokens like Basic Attention Token (BAT), Aave (AAVE), and others, chosen based on their liquidity,
       market cap, and community trust.
  history: |
    The idea of Maker was first introduced on March 26, 2015, when Rune Christensen published “Introducing eDollar, the
    Ultimate Stablecoin Built on Ethereum” with the goal of creating a permissionless credit system that would allow users
    to take out loans collateralized by crypto assets. <br /><br />
    On Dec. 10, 2017, Maker's original whitepaper, "Dai (now Sai) Stablecoin System" was published. The system utilized
    Collateral Debt Position (CDP) smart contracts with ether (ETH) as the only acceptable form of collateral, resulting in
    the name Single-Collateral Dai (SCD), or Sai. While SCD proved effective, the goal was eventually transitioning to
    Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD), allowing other forms of collateral to be used. <br /><br />
    On Nov. 18, 2019, the protocol was upgraded to MCD, with Basic Attention Token (BAT) being voted as the second collateral
    available. In addition to allowing new forms of collateral, MCD also introduced (i) the DAI Savings Rate (DSR), allowing
    tokenholders to earn yield by depositing DAI into a “Pot” that employs various DeFi strategies, and (ii) Collateral Auctions,
    creating a competitive market in the event of liquidations. <br /><br />
    Notably, Maker was originally built by Maker Foundation, which controlled the protocol's contract at launch. However, on March
    25, 2020, the foundation transitioned control to MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization composed of MKR
    tokenholders. <br /><br />
    A governance proposal was launched in March 2021 to onboard real-world assets (RWAs) to Maker Vaults. Several types of RWAs have
    been integrated, including but not limited to real estate loans, freight invoices, and silver. In addition, a forum discussion
    was initiated on Sept. 7, 2023, that contemplated using ~$100.00 million to explore ways to offer tokenized T-Bills. As of
    January 2024, no further actions have been taken toward bringing T-Bills onchain. The project team ratified universal governing
    laws, named the "Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifacts" for the Maker ecosystem on March 27, 2023, in preparation for
    continued decentralization.
  roadmap: |
    On May 12, 2023, MakerDAO announced the release of a five-phase roadmap for the project. Per a forum post by Rune Christensen, 
    the new roadmap, dubbed "Endgame" will be rolled out as follows:
    <br /><br />
    * Phase One (Beta Launch) - This phase will introduce a full rebrand of the project, establishing a unified brand for DAI and
      Maker while launching two new tokens codenamed "NewStable" and "NewGovToken". In this phase, DAI and MKR will not be phased
      out, although users will be able to upgrade both tokens for "NewStable" and "NewGovToken" respectively. "NewGovToken" will
      also include a redenomination from the MKR token supply at a rate of 12,000:1.
    * Phase Two (SubDAO Launch) - This phase will introduce six SubDAOs funded by "NewStable" token emissions. These subDAOs will
      represent decentralized and specialized divisions of MakerDAO, bringing greater governance efficiency to the ecosystem. SubDAOs
      will be categorized as "FacilitatorDAOs" and "AllocatorDAOs" with each subDAO having a unique governance process to enable
      specialization and independent decision-making.
    * Phase Three (Governance AI Tools Launch) - This phase will introduce AI Governance tools that will modify, improve, summarize,
      and interpret "the Atlas" a governance rulebook containing all governance processes within the ecosystem. Another notable addition
      will be Aligned Voter Committees (AVCs), which will enable tokenholders to access governance and AI tools to make more
      informed governance decisions.
    * Phase Four (Governance Participation Incentive Launch) - This phase will introduce the Sagittarius Lockstake Engine (SLE) to promote
      user participation in governance by unlocking “NewStable.” Six farms for SubDAO tokens will also be introduced, where users will earn
      (farm) "NewGovToken" while participating in SubDAO governance. Notably, users (i) with IP addresses from the United States or (ii)
      using VPNs will be prohibited from farming these SubDAO tokens.
    * Phase Five (NewChain Launch and Final Endgame State) - The fifth and final phase will introduce the release of a blockchain that will
      house all backend logic for SubDAO tokenomics and MakerDAO governance security. Once the chain launches, "MakerDAO will permanently enter
      the Endgame State where further major changes are impossible, and it's core processes and balance of power remain decentralized,
      self-sustainable and immutable forever". Rune Christiansen created a forum post on Sept. 1, 2023, suggesting that NewChain would be best
      created by forking Solana's source code, with Cosmos as the next best option. A commercially reasonable search found no other information
      regarding the development of NewChain.
    <br /><br />
    As of January 2024, the features in the Endgame roadmap are still under development and are expected to begin rolling out in early 2024. To
    this end, MakerDAO approved two proposals (MIP102c2 SP20 and MIP102c2 SP21) that serve as amendments to the Alignment Artifacts in preparation
    for the beginning of Phase One. However, no additional timeline was given for the start of Phase One. Additional details regarding Maker's roadmap
    can be seen here. As of the same date, Maker and the MKR token are fully operational, and Core Units elected by MakerDAO are responsible for
    operating as the protocol's "next-generation workforce".

      - title: Regulatory Framework
        value: |
          MakerDAO operates in a decentralized manner, making it challenging to classify within traditional
          financial services regulatory frameworks in the UK and Europe. Its structure as a DAO and the way
          it facilitates transactions without acting as a lender in a traditional sense place it outside of
          many existing regulations that would apply to consumer credit providers or P2P lending platforms.

        value: N.A.
      - title: AML/CFT Compliance KYC Procedures
        value: |
          The decentralized nature of MakerDAO complicates the application of typical Anti-Money Laundering
          (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.
          Traditional compliance mechanisms, like customer information collection, are not straightforwardly
          applicable to a system where lending and borrowing are mediated by smart contracts without a central authority.
      - title: Data Protection
        value: |
          * Blockchain Transparency: Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are transparent and immutable.
            This means once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a clear audit trail.
          * Anonymity and Pseudonymity: Users interact with the blockchain using addresses that do not directly
            reveal their real-world identities. However, this does not mean activities are entirely anonymous but pseudonymous, offering a level of privacy.
          * Smart Contract Security: MakerDAO's operations are managed by smart contracts, which are self-executing
            contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. While smart contracts are secure
            by design, their security heavily depends on the quality of the code. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts
            can potentially be exploited, highlighting the importance of rigorous code audits and security practices.
      - title: Consumer Protection Measures
        value: |
          * Decentralization and Governance: MakerDAO is governed by a decentralized community of MKR token holders who
            vote on changes to the protocol. This governance model allows for a democratic decision-making process, where
            changes aimed at protecting consumers or adjusting the system for better stability can be proposed and voted upon.
          * Collateralization and Liquidation Mechanisms: To mint DAI, users must over-collateralize, meaning they must
            deposit more value in Ethereum or other accepted assets than the amount of DAI they wish to generate. This mechanism
            protects against volatility. If the collateral's value falls below a certain threshold, it can be liquidated to
            ensure the system remains solvent, protecting the value of DAI.
          * Integration with External Platforms: Consumer protection on the user interface level, such as data privacy and
            transaction security, also depends on how third-party platforms integrating MakerDAO's protocols handle user data
            and security.
      - title: Reporting and Transparency
        value: |
          The open nature of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and the status of collateralized positions within
          MakerDAO and decision-making processes are publicly visible and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain. This provides
          a form of transparency and allows for independent audits, although the DAO itself does not follow traditional
          reporting mechanisms.

          The operation of MakerDAO relies on the principles of decentralization, with mechanisms such as automated trading bots (Keepers)
          to maintain DAI's peg to the dollar and manage the liquidation of collateral in a decentralized manner. These operational aspects
          are designed to ensure the protocol's stability and compliance with its internal rules without central oversight.

      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * DAI is created and managed by the MakerDAO protocol, which is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) running on the Ethereum
            blockchain. This protocol includes a series of smart contracts that manage the issuance and stability of DAI.
          * To mint DAI, users lock collateral, such as ETH or other supported assets, into a smart contract called a Vault (previously known as
            a Collateralized Debt Position or CDP). The user can then generate DAI against this collateral. The amount of DAI that can be minted
            is determined by the collateralization ratio, which ensures that there is always more value locked up than the amount of DAI in circulation.
          * DAI maintains its peg to the USD through external market mechanisms and internal economic incentives. For example, when the price of
            DAI is above $1, users are incentivized to pay back their DAI (which burns the token) and unlock their collateral, increasing the supply
            of DAI and pushing the price down. Conversely, when the price is below $1, users are encouraged to mint more DAI by opening new Vaults.
          * DAI represents a significant technological advancement in creating a decentralized, stable, and scalable currency. Its success has not only
            proven the concept of a stablecoin but also paved the way for more complex financial systems to be built on blockchain technology.

  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value: 
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          MakerDAO's governance structure is decentralized, meaning it operates based on the collective decision-making of its token holders. The
          organization uses a DAO model, where decisions are made through proposals and voting to ensure democratic governance over its protocols
          and operations.
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Voting rights within MakerDAO are granted to holders of its governance token, MKR. MKR token holders can propose changes, vote on various
          governance proposals, and have a say in the direction and management of the protocol. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of
          MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief.
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Token governance in MakerDAO revolves around the MKR token. MKR holders are responsible for governing the Maker Protocol, including
          risk management, collateral decisions, and the stability fee adjustments for DAI.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Proposals can be submitted by any MKR token holder. These proposals might range from changes to the system, updates to the protocol,
          or modifications to governance itself. There's usually a formal process for submission, including a discussion phase before a proposal
          goes to vote. https://vote.makerdao.com
      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          MakerDAO utilizes an on-chain voting mechanism, allowing MKR holders to vote directly on proposals. Votes are typically weighted by the
          amount of MKR a voter holds, ensuring that those with a larger stake in the protocol have a proportionally larger say.
      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          **DAI** <br />
          DAI does not have an initial allocation. <br />
          DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies. It maintains its peg to the US dollar through a system
          of smart contracts which automatically adjust the total supply of DAI to keep its price stable. When the price of DAI is above $1, the system
          encourages the creation of more DAI to bring the price down, which is done by decreasing the stability fee (interest rate) for creating DAI.
          Conversely, when the price of DAI is below $1, the system discourages the creation of more DAI to push the price up, which is done by increasing
          the stability fee. Therefore, the supply of DAI is not predetermined but is constantly changing in response to market conditions. You can find
          the latest amount on https://makerburn.com/#/charts
    
          **MKR** <br />
          The Initial token distribution of MKR is as follows:
          * 69.50% is allocated to Founders & Project
          * 15.00% is allocated to Team
          * 4.00% is allocated to Seed Round 1
          * 6.00% is allocated to Seed Round 2
          * 5.50% is allocated to Seed Round 3
          MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens during inception. The total number of MKR in existence can fluctuate based on how the system runs.
          When the Maker vault is liquidated, and the collateral auction and Maker Buffer of Dai are insufficient to repay the vault debt, the protocol will
          mint MKR (increasing the number of MKR in circulation), which will then be sold to Dai bidders. Conversely, if Dai's auction proceeds and stability
          fee payments exceed the Maker buffer limit (a figure set by Maker governance), they will sell excess Dai in exchange for MKR through a surplus auction.
          The Maker Protocol automatically destroys the collected MKR, thus reducing the total supply of MKR.
      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          MakerDAO's ecosystem includes diverse stakeholders, including MKR token holders, DAI users, developers, and integration partners.
      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Participation in governance is conducted on-chain, meaning that all votes and proposals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency
          and immutability of governance actions. Detailed analysis to be included.
      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          The MakerDAO system manages reserves through the collateralization of assets to mint DAI. The reserves are in the form of various cryptocurrencies submitted
          by users, managed by smart contracts to ensure solvency and stability of DAI.
      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          MakerDAO has mechanisms in place for emergency decision-making, known as Emergency Shutdown. This can be triggered if the system is under threat, safeguarding
          users' assets and the integrity of DAI.
      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          In the event of a significant change or fork in the protocol, governance decisions would guide the process, ensuring that stakeholders have a say in the
          direction and implementation of such changes.
      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          Compliance oversight potentially comes from the decentralized governance itself or through external advisories and audits.
      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          Accountability is built into the governance model through the visibility of all transactions and votes on the blockchain, along with community oversight and
          the possibility for stakeholders to propose changes if the system's integrity is at risk.
