After trying different methods of payments for over two hours, I get a huge questionnaire to upload bank statements, pictures, ID cards... around 15-20 questions. After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning. I am not dealing with huge amounts of cash, I am just learning the crypto world. Stop SCAMMING people and let them use their own money."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

The fact that they stop withdrawals when they want to, until they want to, without giving a specific date, that's already a scam to me. No wonder they're not available in US, UK and Canada."

Then, if you want to withdraw only a part, they block you. It means you can\u2019t access your money you invested. Not only about profits, even not your initial funds. After they tell you that you wan in a reward some thousands of dollars, in my case over 300\u2019000. But they ask first to pay 50\u2019000 to the access to your funds and then also the reward of 300\u2019000. Guess what happens if you pay 50\u2019000. Nothing. Maybe another excuse for another fee to pay to get access to what belongs to you. Absolutely fraudulent if a platform blocks access to your funds you paid and invested."

Someone was trying to use my account, I noticed some activities that were not mine in my account, so I reported, but stupid me I reported before withdrawing my money from it, they obviously block my account, and after I did all the changes they request me to do it to unblock it, in additional a LIVE video from zoom with the team, and months later my account still BLOCKED, and they are again asking the same things I already did and ANOTHER VIDEO! Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

Even if the company is legit, they're more of a scam. A hidden scam though. The fact that they stop withdrawals when they want to, until they want to, without giving a specific date, that's already a scam to me. No wonder they're not available in US, UK and Canada."
