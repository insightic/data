After trying different methods of payments for over two hours, I get a huge questionnaire to upload bank statements, pictures, ID cards... around 15-20 questions. After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning. I am not dealing with huge amounts of cash, I am just learning the crypto world. Stop SCAMMING people and let them use their own money."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

The fact that they stop withdrawals when they want to, until they want to, without giving a specific date, that's already a scam to me. No wonder they're not available in US, UK and Canada."

Then, if you want to withdraw only a part, they block you. It means you can\u2019t access your money you invested. Not only about profits, even not your initial funds. After they tell you that you wan in a reward some thousands of dollars, in my case over 300\u2019000. But they ask first to pay 50\u2019000 to the access to your funds and then also the reward of 300\u2019000. Guess what happens if you pay 50\u2019000. Nothing. Maybe another excuse for another fee to pay to get access to what belongs to you. Absolutely fraudulent if a platform blocks access to your funds you paid and invested."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

Security concerns also emerge as a critical issue from the negative reviews, suggesting that the platform may need to bolster its security measures to enhance user trust. The mixed average rating of 2.67 reflects this polarization in user sentiment. Areas for potential improvement include simplifying the user interface to cater to less technically proficient users and enhancing customer support to address user issues more effectively. Further investigation could be beneficial to understand the specific security vulnerabilities and to develop strategies to mitigate them, ensuring a more consistent and secure user experience.",

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

From the get-go, the platform's simplicity made diving into crypto trading a breeze, even for a newbie like me. Deposits and withdrawals have been a non-issue, which is a breath of fresh air in an industry where such transactions can sometimes be nerve-wracking. Plus, whenever I've had a question, their customer support team has been lightning-fast in their responses, making me feel genuinely valued as a user. Overall, Bitget has made my crypto journey smooth sailing, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly platform."

The customer support team is noted to be responsive, yet this responsiveness does not always translate into effective problem resolution, leaving users frustrated.

Educational initiatives are highlighted, reflecting an awareness of the need to improve understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency technologies among the broader public. However, the absence of new developments, controversies, or milestones suggests a period of consolidation rather than rapid growth or upheaval.

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning. I am not dealing with huge amounts of cash, I am just learning the crypto world. Stop SCAMMING people and let them use their own money."
