After trying different methods of payments for over two hours, I get a huge questionnaire to upload bank statements, pictures, ID cards... around 15-20 questions. After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning. I am not dealing with huge amounts of cash, I am just learning the crypto world. Stop SCAMMING people and let them use their own money."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

The fact that they stop withdrawals when they want to, until they want to, without giving a specific date, that's already a scam to me. No wonder they're not available in US, UK and Canada."

Then, if you want to withdraw only a part, they block you. It means you can\u2019t access your money you invested. Not only about profits, even not your initial funds. After they tell you that you wan in a reward some thousands of dollars, in my case over 300\u2019000. But they ask first to pay 50\u2019000 to the access to your funds and then also the reward of 300\u2019000. Guess what happens if you pay 50\u2019000. Nothing. Maybe another excuse for another fee to pay to get access to what belongs to you. Absolutely fraudulent if a platform blocks access to your funds you paid and invested."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

Security concerns also emerge as a critical issue from the negative reviews, suggesting that the platform may need to bolster its security measures to enhance user trust. The mixed average rating of 2.67 reflects this polarization in user sentiment. Areas for potential improvement include simplifying the user interface to cater to less technically proficient users and enhancing customer support to address user issues more effectively. Further investigation could be beneficial to understand the specific security vulnerabilities and to develop strategies to mitigate them, ensuring a more consistent and secure user experience.",

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

From the get-go, the platform's simplicity made diving into crypto trading a breeze, even for a newbie like me. Deposits and withdrawals have been a non-issue, which is a breath of fresh air in an industry where such transactions can sometimes be nerve-wracking. Plus, whenever I've had a question, their customer support team has been lightning-fast in their responses, making me feel genuinely valued as a user. Overall, Bitget has made my crypto journey smooth sailing, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly platform."

Educational initiatives are highlighted, reflecting an awareness of the need to improve understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency technologies among the broader public.

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

Despite following their Support's directions to maintain said positions which ended up getting liquidated a day later, they refused to compensate my position based on my Stop Loss which did not automatically terminate the position as intended, even though on multiple replies that they've acknowledged an issue with their setting and is currently undergoing changes. Also, despite having a transcript of the dialogue that clearly documented their instructions, their Support first denied the existence of said conversation, but later simply ignored the fact when I referred to the dialogue and simply blamed the losses on the customer saying I couldn't closed it myself any time. Then my request to have the case referred to a senior manager was also ignored, and all I received were cut-n-paste scripts by their low level Support staff that was abrupt and unhelpful. Finally, even though my losses is equivalent to probably less than a minute of their trading fees, and much less than free bonuses that they give out to new customers, which I suggested that they can use on my case since I'm also a new joiner, they simply refused and again use their copy/paste script on their replies. I've realized that Bitget is only interested in taking new users' funds for their own gains and provides zero support even when the issue lies with their platform. Moreover, they put flaky tools/products on their platform for unknowing customers to use that will jeopardize their funds, only to later blame the user. Be warned!!!"

I wrote many emails to inform the other party, and each time the other party responded by asking me to provide the transaction ID and wallet address. Then I went to their community to find their community staff to tell them about what happened to me, and their community staff directly banned me. I changed my identity and went into the community to complain, but was banned again. Recently, the bitget wallet suddenly sent me an email to respond that the bitget wallet would not compensate my losses, and the reason was that  Maybe I leaked my private password, or other unknown problems led to my fund loss. I would like to ask your platform, why didn\u2019t you steal my money? In addition to you, who else has the ability to make my money disappear within an hour of my first transfer to your platform? I don\u2019t believe anyone would pay attention to an account that has no previous transaction records, and no one has the ability to steal my funds as soon as they are transferred to your platform without any previous transaction records. So it is more likely that your platform stole my $1,600 in virtual currency, or it was one of your insiders."

I wrote many emails to inform the other party, and each time the other party responded by asking me to provide the transaction ID and wallet address. Then I went to their community to find their community staff to tell them about what happened to me, and their community staff directly banned me. I changed my identity and went into the community to complain, but was banned again. Recently, the bitget wallet suddenly sent me an email to respond that the bitget wallet would not compensate my losses, and the reason was that  Maybe I leaked my private password, or other unknown problems led to my fund loss. I would like to ask your platform, why didn\u2019t you steal my money? In addition to you, who else has the ability to make my money disappear within an hour of my first transfer to your platform? I don\u2019t believe anyone would pay attention to an account that has no previous transaction records, and no one has the ability to steal my funds as soon as they are transferred to your platform without any previous transaction records. So it is more likely that your platform stole my $1,600 in virtual currency, or it was one of your insiders."

I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

I have provided all of the information which they have requested i.e. three months bank statements, passport, copies of the front and back of the debit card which I used to fund my account but yet  upon all of this they keep deliberately and on purpose running me around in cycles and asking me to \u2018be patient\u2019 simply because they do not want to give me my money back!  They are evil.  They are trying to wear me out and hope that I eventually forget about my investment. AVOID BITGET AT ALL COSTS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f. THEY ARE ROBBING AND SCAMMING PEOPLE.  IF YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY YOU WILL LOSE IT!!! If I could give these evil people/company a -10 out of 10 I would. Pure wickedness!

I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

At first they promised to solve within 15 days, but now already month has gone, and all they write is \"we still reviewing,  please wait \". Don't use this exchange!"

They freeze my account & tell me l need to be reverified again.Interesting that this happens after l make my largest deposit. I fill out a torturously long questionnaire that wants my tax info, bank statements, employment information, etc. etc. plus a letter assuming all accountability for transactions. I send it in & have spent 3 days trying to get confirmation of receipt. Meanwhile they have my USD & despite my asking for updates, no response. Lousy UX & zero sign of customer service.They are scam artists, if you put your money in, they\u2019ll find a way to keep it."

Awaiting reward since 07/04/2024 was meant to receive it by the 10/04/2024 and is still under review to this day. Just been told the rewards are shared out on a first come first served basis. Yet if that was the case why is the promotion still being made available for users and it says does not end until 20/06/2024. I think maybe bitget have got it wrong."
