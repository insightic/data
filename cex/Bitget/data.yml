history: "Bitgetâ€™s roots trace back to a dedicated team with a background in traditional finance who explored blockchain technology in 2015. Officially founded amid the bear market of 2018 after its founders studied the Bitcoin whitepaper and Ethereum ecosystem, Bitget emerged from the conviction that cryptocurrency would significantly influence future financial systems and potentially aid unbanked populations. Despite the market's volatility, Bitget was part of the minority who persisted, focusing on long-term growth and product innovation. Today, the platform emphasizes achieving a more equitable world through crypto evolution, with a mission to enable secure, efficient, and smart digital transactions globally. The team is globally diverse with over 1500 employees from 60 countries, reinforcing its extensive reach and impact in the crypto sector."
