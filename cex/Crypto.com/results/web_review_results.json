The whole system works around holding of CRO and they use that token to cash out to pay for marketing and internal costs. My CRO went from A$1 to $0.10 and during the crypto recovery when bitcoin went ATH the CRO token barely whimpered as they cashed in. These are the worst group of people in the Crypto industry yet to be prosecuted. Dont. DONT DONT!! use this platform. I am not against Crypto but these people are snakes by any other name."

Moving them off the exchange was even easier than expected.  Only significant room for improvement I would suggest is the user experience of the platform.  It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning.

No matter how many times I tried, It kept saying \"network error, please try again.\" Everything else in the app was live and well so it definitely was NOT a network problem. Is it a coincidence that just when I was making good money that all of a sudden we have network errors that wouldn't let me sell the contract? I cleared the app's cache, restarted it, nothing worked. Eventually, after an hour or two, the contract went the other way until it was blown up and I went from nice profits to very ugly losses. These kinds of things should NEVER happen on a trading platform! So far they didn't bother to respond to my email about the incident, but I smell fraud from miles away. I lost trust in them."

Then they told me to buy their card and use the money. Their must be made by AI. Artificial Imbeciles. Who will tell their client to spend their money in order to have it back? So the other imbecile here did what they told. So, all of a sudden they decided to freeze my card. I went to the app to try to unfreeze it and the app told me to get in touch. Again, how can an institution be so incompetent? I opened the chat and after a while I talked to someone who resembled a human being. After explaining my case 3 times she or he or they or ze told me to call a specialist. Wait. Who was I talking to then? A trained monkey?So here I am, two hours later waiting for someone with half a brain to solve my MISTERY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNFREEZE CARRRDDD."

Moving them off the exchange was even easier than expected.  Only significant room for improvement I would suggest is the user experience of the platform.  It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

What is the point. I won\u2019t be surprised if they will be asked to stop trading in the UK and other countries soon.  Customer support are bots and any real person can\u2019t give you a proper answer. Fees are hidden in the spread, BEWARE!!!"

It happened often that the operator is not able to help me and he/she had to ask his \"relevant staff\", with the promise to give me an answer. After many days of silence I have to recontact them, with the same epilogue. That happened many times.I have found big security issues. My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

Since then it has been like a gaming task of hoops to jump through and tests , never the same person answers more than once and always ask you to start again . Finally completed the tasks only to be told to make a security video that even with the help of two IT professionals have not found a way to send the video it\u2019s like I have completed the tasks and they say to themselves - this guy is getting close to restating his account let\u2019s block his video so he can\u2019t get his money back . Customer service is appalling nobody cares . I would tell anyone never use this company you can kiss your money good bye and they don\u2019t care . The video is 54 meg and they say they can take up to 100. It claims there is a link on their set up page to send it - not there . They told me to close the app and reset up which I did - it didn\u2019t work and the person who told me to do it doesn\u2019t now answer my emails - 7 months of hell . Don\u2019t use them ."

However, there is a notable absence of discussion on regulatory governance, which could be a critical issue as it affects market stability and investor confidence.
