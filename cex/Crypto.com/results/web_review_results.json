                "review": "If I could give lower than 1 star I would. Crypto is touted as tranforming the financial services industry but these people are not a step in the right direction. The whole system works around holding of CRO and they use that token to cash out to pay for marketing and internal costs. My CRO went from A$1 to $0.10 and during the crypto recovery when bitcoin went ATH the CRO token barely whimpered as they cashed in. These are the worst group of people in the Crypto industry yet to be prosecuted. Dont. DONT DONT!! use this platform. I am not against Crypto but these people are snakes by any other name."

Customer service is completely inept and unable to resolve even the most simple concerns. I cannot think of a company that I have grown to despise more. They are the worst. Do yourself a favor and avoid them at all costs!!!"

I spent 16 hours with the customer support chat. After the first 4 hours they tell me that they will open a ticket for me. Proceeds to tell me to wait, 12 hours later I don't even have a ticket number to refer to, the next customer support person has taken over the same chat (I replied to them via email) and still has no clue what this is about. They proceed to tell me to continue waiting."

Moving them off the exchange was even easier than expected.  Only significant room for improvement I would suggest is the user experience of the platform.  It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

Every time you contact them to chase they pretend to not know what is happening. It\u2019s exhausting. Coinbase dealt with the same issue within 24 hours, crypto.com are a complete scam."

All looked well and after 6 months it was time to make a withdrawal. I was first told it would take $6,000 to cover the taxes and then told they had made a mistake and it would be $10,000, I called them out as scammers and turned it over to the FBI. Avoid Crypto.com, Will Howe and CoinMarketCap at all costs."

I have been scammed as well before and definitely feel their frustrations. However blaming a company because someone outside the company scammed you is low. It\u2019s like giving McDonalds a 1 star because you bought a McChicken and someone else took it from your hands and started eating it."
