The whole system works around holding of CRO and they use that token to cash out to pay for marketing and internal costs. My CRO went from A$1 to $0.10 and during the crypto recovery when bitcoin went ATH the CRO token barely whimpered as they cashed in. These are the worst group of people in the Crypto industry yet to be prosecuted. Dont. DONT DONT!! use this platform. I am not against Crypto but these people are snakes by any other name."

It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning.

No matter how many times I tried, It kept saying \"network error, please try again.\" Everything else in the app was live and well so it definitely was NOT a network problem. Is it a coincidence that just when I was making good money that all of a sudden we have network errors that wouldn't let me sell the contract? I cleared the app's cache, restarted it, nothing worked. Eventually, after an hour or two, the contract went the other way until it was blown up and I went from nice profits to very ugly losses. These kinds of things should NEVER happen on a trading platform! So far they didn't bother to respond to my email about the incident, but I smell fraud from miles away. I lost trust in them."

Then they told me to buy their card and use the money. Their must be made by AI. Artificial Imbeciles. Who will tell their client to spend their money in order to have it back? So the other imbecile here did what they told. So, all of a sudden they decided to freeze my card. I went to the app to try to unfreeze it and the app told me to get in touch. Again, how can an institution be so incompetent? I opened the chat and after a while I talked to someone who resembled a human being. After explaining my case 3 times she or he or they or ze told me to call a specialist. Wait. Who was I talking to then? A trained monkey?So here I am, two hours later waiting for someone with half a brain to solve my MISTERY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNFREEZE CARRRDDD."

My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

After many days of silence I have to recontact them, with the same epilogue. That happened many times.I have found big security issues. My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

While the security features and user-friendly interface are praised, these positives are overshadowed by the negative experiences of many users. Critical issues seem to center on functionality, particularly with account access, which is a fundamental aspect of user experience. The poor performance of the interface suggests a need for technical improvements to enhance stability and usability. To address these concerns and improve overall satisfaction, the app developers should prioritize enhancing customer support, refining the interface, and ensuring reliable account access.",

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

                "review": "This by far has got to be the worst Absolutely terrible experience with this crypto app. They market it as a versatile Visa card you can use anywhere, but that's far from the truth. They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"
