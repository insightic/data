I was on Coinbase and opened an account on OKX as Coinbase did not work with my wallet.As soon as my funds came into the account, OKX locked my account and started asking for all kinds of verification without giving any reason. This was within 2 days of opening the account. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Find another exchange to trust with your money and tokens."

I've encountered some challenging situations with OKX, but when I reached out to them, I received the assistance I needed. Even though I wasn't entirely satisfied with the outcome, they made an effort to be as objective and informative as possible. I commend the team, but I recommend improving the KYC tools."

                "review": "Beware! Never open up an account with OKX! You will have a lot of hazzle only, because their customer service does not work anymore. OKX suspends your account and asks for verification all of a sudden with no apparent reason. Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I tried to withdraw 3500.00 from my wallet and they asked me to pay 1750.00 to show i am legitimate  once I had done that they asked me for a further 4200.00 which buy this stage I made further investigations and I did not pay as I realize its a scam. I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

For any compliance things, their quick fix is to freeze customer accounts. The management looks quite incompetent in handling account matters. Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

Second, then I tried to withdrawall my USDT to other platform, as last step was they asked me for authentification code, but they never sent it to me. I contacted the support but they done nothing. Also they modified my login password and for reset it, you need again an authentification code wich they never send. Absolutely scammers."
