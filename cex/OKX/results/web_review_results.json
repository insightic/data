I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

For any compliance things, their quick fix is to freeze customer accounts. The management looks quite incompetent in handling account matters. Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

They have frozen my account with \u00a31600 in it and I have no idea how to unfreeze it. I asked for help with the verification process but they said this is not a service they offer. It is impossible to actually speak to anyone there. Suggest this company is avoided at all costs."

He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.
