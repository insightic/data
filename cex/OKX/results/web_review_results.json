I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

For any compliance things, their quick fix is to freeze customer accounts. The management looks quite incompetent in handling account matters. Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

Community news, including project introductions and strategies for resilience, reflects an active and adaptive community that values transparency and collaboration. However, there is a lack of discussion on regulatory governance, which could be an area for further investigation, as it is crucial for the long-term stability and legitimacy of blockchain projects.
