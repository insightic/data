Coinbase, then tell me they cannot trace the money. It is a scam because you have to log a ticket each time. It shows that they don't want to resolve anything but just prolong the issues until the person gets fed up and gives up. What a bloody scam. No support, what so ever. I will take further action."

I recently moved over $40K into my account and Coinbase immediately froze it for security reason.  Original hold was for 7 days.  After verification that all was good, on day 6 Coinbase increased hold to 30 days.  Then 3 days later after another verification process, Coinbase restarted the 30-day clock. Pretty sure in 30 days Coinbase will find another reason to lock out funds for even longer.  Best not to ever use them if you value you funds or expect customer service."

Although they look all hi tech and professional they are scammers and their customer service is a joke. I am in the process of retrieving my money from them- the formal complaint takes 45 business days to process. All this time they will be holding your money hostage. Their customer service is very circular providing no solution- bouncing customers from one chat to another, you CANNOT talk to a real person. Beware and if do use them dont hold a lot of money there- you will not be able to get them out."

In order for us to better assist you, can you please provide information or clarification as to how we can help?\"AND IMMEDIATELY after this message they close the case. And they NEVER reply to my follow up email in which I resend the question according to their request. Probably this is the technique for the customer care staff to spare the work. Strange is different personas send the same canned text, like if it was not one person's technique... They reply and close the ticket, and if they are not checked further technically it looks like a resolved case. This happened now the second time with the same problem."

The worst part was there is absolutely no warning. An hour later I was finally able to chat with customer service who said too bad, the \"blockchain\" decides the fee. I am definitely out of coinbase."

Their employees are incompetent  and ignorant to understand the situation After 3 months they are still asking me to provide my bank account statement to show i have not received the funds, they are so ignorant the do not understand I have used Western UNion and if they have not received the fund back from Coinbase bank there is no money returned to my back account...If they cannot handle traditional banking system imagine how much crypto they steal from people with micro transaction! The company must be closed down, and investigated and audited"

I have sent all the required documents in every iteration of their requests, but they always come back with additional ones that weren't there before. Why not just ask me all the required documents and questions straight away? And now I wait for 30 days between each request until god knows when. It's been almost 5 months and the customer support is slow and unable to give me any straight answers."

                "review": "Unfortunately there aren\u2019t many alternative options when it comes to regulated crypto exchanges, Coinbase pretty much has a monopoly and taking full advantage by illegal practices that involve random unjustified account freezes. A huge problem I have had as a decade long customer is they refuse to provide any customer support by phone. Everything is forcibly done through email by design so they have unlimited time to resolve your case. Sometimes an account is left hanging for months, even over minor issues. They also use overseas reps who are often useless and serve as mere secretaries who\u2019s purpose is to stall or hand out case numbers. I wish the FTC would investigate there practices because no bank or credit card company would get away with this, but for some strange reason these guys get a pass because they are crypto."

Coinbase, then tell me they cannot trace the money. It is a scam because you have to log a ticket each time. It shows that they don't want to resolve anything but just prolong the issues until the person gets fed up and gives up. What a bloody scam. No support, what so ever. I will take further action."

Call their customer service a dozen of times,  but it is useless.  All they do is email the KYC team asking to review the submitted paperwork. Totally a joke!!  Filed a complaint with their complaint department several times( they can review it up to 90 days!),  received an answer that the KYC team is still waiting for me to submit the paperwork!!  I called Support,  sked which paperwork I still need to submit - they responded that all necessary paperwork was submitted already and that the KYC team just needs to review it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Recently begin to receive generic emails from KYC team requesting to confirm my account and providing with the FAQ links to the general info. The last link they send me with the request to provide the info was broken! I replied to the email with explanation and screenshots- no response. Called the customer service- no results . And there is NO Time-limits for them to review your KYC info.Mine has been in \u201ca manual review \u201c for 6 months now\u2026My account with $20,000 is restricted. Not able to withdraw my money, not able to buy coins or anything else\u2026Filed a complaint again\u2026 I got a feeling that they are just regular scammers and the owner will be another Bankman-Fried from FTX and end up in jail.Bad ,bad actors. Do NOT recommend!!!! P.S.Read on Reddit that it was still possible to withdraw your coins while the account was under review . Withdrawing mine for sure!!!"
