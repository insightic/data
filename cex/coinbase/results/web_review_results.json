Coinbase, then tell me they cannot trace the money. It is a scam because you have to log a ticket each time. It shows that they don't want to resolve anything but just prolong the issues until the person gets fed up and gives up. What a bloody scam. No support, what so ever. I will take further action."

I recently moved over $40K into my account and Coinbase immediately froze it for security reason.  Original hold was for 7 days.  After verification that all was good, on day 6 Coinbase increased hold to 30 days.  Then 3 days later after another verification process, Coinbase restarted the 30-day clock. Pretty sure in 30 days Coinbase will find another reason to lock out funds for even longer.  Best not to ever use them if you value you funds or expect customer service."

Although they look all hi tech and professional they are scammers and their customer service is a joke. I am in the process of retrieving my money from them- the formal complaint takes 45 business days to process. All this time they will be holding your money hostage. Their customer service is very circular providing no solution- bouncing customers from one chat to another, you CANNOT talk to a real person. Beware and if do use them dont hold a lot of money there- you will not be able to get them out."

In order for us to better assist you, can you please provide information or clarification as to how we can help?\"AND IMMEDIATELY after this message they close the case. And they NEVER reply to my follow up email in which I resend the question according to their request. Probably this is the technique for the customer care staff to spare the work. Strange is different personas send the same canned text, like if it was not one person's technique... They reply and close the ticket, and if they are not checked further technically it looks like a resolved case. This happened now the second time with the same problem."

The worst part was there is absolutely no warning. An hour later I was finally able to chat with customer service who said too bad, the \"blockchain\" decides the fee. I am definitely out of coinbase."

Their employees are incompetent  and ignorant to understand the situation After 3 months they are still asking me to provide my bank account statement to show i have not received the funds, they are so ignorant the do not understand I have used Western UNion and if they have not received the fund back from Coinbase bank there is no money returned to my back account...If they cannot handle traditional banking system imagine how much crypto they steal from people with micro transaction! The company must be closed down, and investigated and audited"

I have sent all the required documents in every iteration of their requests, but they always come back with additional ones that weren't there before. Why not just ask me all the required documents and questions straight away? And now I wait for 30 days between each request until god knows when. It's been almost 5 months and the customer support is slow and unable to give me any straight answers."

A huge problem I have had as a decade long customer is they refuse to provide any customer support by phone. Everything is forcibly done through email by design so they have unlimited time to resolve your case. Sometimes an account is left hanging for months, even over minor issues. They also use overseas reps who are often useless and serve as mere secretaries who\u2019s purpose is to stall or hand out case numbers. I wish the FTC would investigate there practices because no bank or credit card company would get away with this, but for some strange reason these guys get a pass because they are crypto."

Filed a complaint with their complaint department several times( they can review it up to 90 days!),  received an answer that the KYC team is still waiting for me to submit the paperwork!!  I called Support,  sked which paperwork I still need to submit - they responded that all necessary paperwork was submitted already and that the KYC team just needs to review it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Recently begin to receive generic emails from KYC team requesting to confirm my account and providing with the FAQ links to the general info. The last link they send me with the request to provide the info was broken! I replied to the email with explanation and screenshots- no response. Called the customer service- no results . And there is NO Time-limits for them to review your KYC info.Mine has been in \u201ca manual review \u201c for 6 months now\u2026My account with $20,000 is restricted. Not able to withdraw my money, not able to buy coins or anything else\u2026Filed a complaint again\u2026 I got a feeling that they are just regular scammers and the owner will be another Bankman-Fried from FTX and end up in jail.Bad ,bad actors. Do NOT recommend!!!! P.S.Read on Reddit that it was still possible to withdraw your coins while the account was under review . Withdrawing mine for sure!!!"

So they can post the type of generic unhelpful replies as you can see below which have nothing to do with customer service and everything to do with reputation management. My case was closed by them with no recourse in November and the review was months ago.  Too little too late!Update: Coinbase responded in the thread as I predicted saying they will look into it, but their email to me still has restrictions on my account and they won't provide a reason.  I watched their CEO Brian Armstrong recently espouse his vision for Coinbase and it is a far cry from what their customer service and compliance teams are doing to actual customers.  I gave you a chance, so now I'm closing my account...Further update.  Coinbase has now finally restored my account to full operability. It took a while so I have now updated the rating to a 3 star.PS thank God for TrustPilot!"

An example is that you can send USDT over Solana to any exchange, but if you do it to coinbase, it will sit in your account on the blockchain but not show up in your Coinbase account...ever. They refuse to let you get your funds and they're the only ones with access to it. Their customer support is a mix of AI and an army of copy pasta drones. You will never get help. It's like using the blockchain but without any sort of access to your accounts (in other words, worse). It's basically just a very poorly functioning dex, with fake customer support, stuck in the past Ethereum era. Cheating, fossil exchange.I'm sure all the money they collect in their wallets for their customers, then denying them access to their funds, helps with their fake numbers for their stocks.Totally and absolutely gross.I'll be filing with regulators."

I honestly wish I could make this my go-to CEX but everything is.. locked and has been so for over 3 months even after contacting support."

Educational initiatives are being highlighted, which implies an acknowledgment of the need for better user understanding and wider knowledge dissemination to support adoption and informed investment decisions. However, there are no significant new developments, controversies, or milestones being discussed, which could mean that the industry is currently in a state of consolidation or that incremental improvements are being made rather than groundbreaking changes. Lastly, the absence of patterns or strategies related to cryptocurrency manipulation tactics in the reviews suggests that the current discourse is centered on legitimate practices, but it also highlights the importance of ongoing vigilance and the potential need for regulatory frameworks to prevent future malpractices.",

Investors show a clear preference for initiatives that enhance user protection, provide education, and ensure the utility of cryptocurrencies, which are seen as critical for fostering confidence and driving long-term adoption. Partnerships with governments and technological support are highlighted as key areas for further development, indicating a need for ongoing collaboration and innovation to align with regulatory standards and improve security infrastructure. The absence of discussions on market trends or predictions suggests a focus on building a stable and responsible foundation for the cryptocurrency market rather than speculating on its short-term fluctuations. To address these findings, continued efforts in enhancing security measures, ensuring compliance with evolving regulations, and promoting eco-friendly practices are recommended for sustainable growth in the cryptocurrency industry.",

On 2023-12-30, I received a Bitcoin transaction which was initially pending. However, shortly after, my account was flagged for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification by Coinbase. This verification process took an unexpectedly long time, lasting 138 days, before finally completing. Since then, I have been unable to locate the status of my Bitcoin transaction. I am concerned that it may be missing or held in a Coinbase cold wallet due to the KYC verification process. I kindly request your prompt assistance in investigating this matter and providing clarification on the status of my Bitcoin transaction. Any information or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response. CASE ID# 19366248ZAIN AHMAD"

They only allow you to transfer out $2000 of crypto per week. Customer service agents wont assist and will keep saying your transfer request has been escalated to stop you from transferring crypto to other wallets. Have been waiting for weeks now. Lodging a complaint with the ombudsmans as this is borderline fraud."

Cryptocurrency filled me with apprehension so to find a fool proof app, which didn\u2019t rip me off with crazy charges was just a joy. I\u2019m no wizard and sure most of it was luck, but it\u2019s been good to me so far. For anyone having a tentative first crypto experience, I\u2019d highly recommend Coinbase as a good place to start, just don\u2019t get carried away!"

The rewards also don't seem to change none I was getting 3.33 1 week and then the next week getting 13.33 and I got the same amount of rewards and when I message them or try and get support they say they will gladly handle this issue for me and don't say anything about what I asked just that the rewards will be added to the account and they never are. Then thats all they say in support and just leave you hanging. Like today I contacted them and he introduced himself and said I will help you and that's literally all he ever said just left me hanging for like 3 hours. Something is obviously wrong when the rates go up more then triple and you get the same amount of rewards and in more time for example I was supposed to get them every 7 days they just added the rewards and it's been 13 days with a higher rate then the last payout reward and I literally got the same amount of rewards as I did last time for 13 days on a 13.33 rate. Not a fan gonna look to move to another platform."

On 2023-12-30, I received a Bitcoin transaction which was initially pending. However, shortly after, my account was flagged for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification by Coinbase. This verification process took an unexpectedly long time, lasting 138 days, before finally completing. Since then, I have been unable to locate the status of my Bitcoin transaction. I am concerned that it may be missing or held in a Coinbase cold wallet due to the KYC verification process. I kindly request your prompt assistance in investigating this matter and providing clarification on the status of my Bitcoin transaction. Any information or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response. CASE ID# 19366248ZAIN AHMAD"
