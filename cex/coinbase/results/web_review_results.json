Coinbase, then tell me they cannot trace the money. It is a scam because you have to log a ticket each time. It shows that they don't want to resolve anything but just prolong the issues until the person gets fed up and gives up. What a bloody scam. No support, what so ever. I will take further action."

I recently moved over $40K into my account and Coinbase immediately froze it for security reason.  Original hold was for 7 days.  After verification that all was good, on day 6 Coinbase increased hold to 30 days.  Then 3 days later after another verification process, Coinbase restarted the 30-day clock. Pretty sure in 30 days Coinbase will find another reason to lock out funds for even longer.  Best not to ever use them if you value you funds or expect customer service."

When I tried to withdraw my remaining funds to my bank it would say \u201ccan\u2019t withdraw due to connection issues\u201d after talking to their customer support for about an hour I received zero help, the customer support clearly didn\u2019t have any idea of what they are doing. All I got was \u201cyou\u2019ll be contacted by email asap\u201dI would highly recommend checking out other platforms."

Although they look all hi tech and professional they are scammers and their customer service is a joke. I am in the process of retrieving my money from them- the formal complaint takes 45 business days to process. All this time they will be holding your money hostage. Their customer service is very circular providing no solution- bouncing customers from one chat to another, you CANNOT talk to a real person. Beware and if do use them dont hold a lot of money there- you will not be able to get them out."

                "review": "Customer support qualifies for the worst possible score. They reply with the same text all the times: \"We apologize for the inconvenience, but your inquiry details did not successfully transfer over to this case. In order for us to better assist you, can you please provide information or clarification as to how we can help?\"AND IMMEDIATELY after this message they close the case. And they NEVER reply to my follow up email in which I resend the question according to their request. Probably this is the technique for the customer care staff to spare the work. Strange is different personas send the same canned text, like if it was not one person's technique... They reply and close the ticket, and if they are not checked further technically it looks like a resolved case. This happened now the second time with the same problem."

Over the last few month I noticed the fee in and out increasing everytime I moved money. Then a couple days ago I moved $88. The fee was $68 leaving me $20 actually sent. The worst part was there is absolutely no warning. An hour later I was finally able to chat with customer service who said too bad, the \"blockchain\" decides the fee. I am definitely out of coinbase."

Rubbish company, I am now raising a formal legal case and raise it with the financial-ombudsmanTHis company is rubbish despite being listed on the New York stockexchange they do not comply with financial institution FCA rules.It is impossible to speak to anyone they only speak through chat bots and emails. Their employees are incompetent  and ignorant to understand the situation After 3 months they are still asking me to provide my bank account statement to show i have not received the funds, they are so ignorant the do not understand I have used Western UNion and if they have not received the fund back from Coinbase bank there is no money returned to my back account...If they cannot handle traditional banking system imagine how much crypto they steal from people with micro transaction! The company must be closed down, and investigated and audited"

Now when I attempt to verify my UK address I receive a notification stating \u2018incorrect country\u2019. I now live abroad and when I raise a complaint/ticket, it automatically closes the case and sends me an email advising \u2018Initially, Coinbase will only offer self-help customer support in your region\u2019. Apparently it\u2019s not possible to call the helpline from outside the UK either. There is no further avenue to solve this issue. An average rating 1.6* based on 9,000 reviews says it all really. Avoid."

The KYC process take too long, especially since they reply to my emails every 30 days approximately. I have sent all the required documents in every iteration of their requests, but they always come back with additional ones that weren't there before. Why not just ask me all the required documents and questions straight away? And now I wait for 30 days between each request until god knows when. It's been almost 5 months and the customer support is slow and unable to give me any straight answers."

After seeing my review Coinbase support contacted me and was able to resolve my issue.

I feel the majority number of ratings are done by people who are not familiar with crypto, or only use it in exchange if there's no other option before exchanging for fiat. Coinbase has treated me extremely well, and i do feel safe. Coinbase pro and all of the new features/futures/learn and earn. It's a good very easy to use exchange with endless opportunity. Once everything is dialed in with latency during major moves/max traffic in bull markets this is 5 star review for me."
