Customer support responded, warned me that it will take about 30 days to solve this problem. They took a fee. After 32 days problem was solved, my ETH was refunded(few grand $worth). So in my personal experience they are legit and ok. Then I bought btc instead of altcoin I previously wanted to buy, and succesfuly withdrawn it. So I will use this exchange in future."

Otherwise they will keep losing customer due to inconvenience and rude people they hire."
