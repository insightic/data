                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

Withdraws took about few hours and unfortunately missed some high opportunities for profit.Hope it will be changed and fixed"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

When I returned to the order, it was closed and I couldn't approve my fiat money transferring. I contacted with merchant and she has approved she's got my money on her bank account. The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

Performance problems with the app's interface are also a common complaint, pointing to a need for technical improvements to enhance stability and usability.

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

When I returned to the order, it was closed and I couldn't approve my fiat money transferring. I contacted with merchant and she has approved she's got my money on her bank account. The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

Again, 1 month passed when they answered. In this letter, only identification data was requested for the third time. I never get any other worthwhile answers.Update: I am now sure that they are playing with me on purpose. I send the data 2 days ago. Today I received an email again to send the data.

All the parts that are enjoyed amongst different exchanges, have been brought together for a more complete trading platform. No issues for me thus far... The challenging thing though is to navigate your way through the fully loaded platform which takes some time. Effort + Efficiency = $$$$$$Keep it up there humans!!! Please don't be in the news soon with legal issues. My heart will be broken."

There was absolutely no information by kucoin why they didn't accept the money and sent it back. Customer agents in chat have no information and also can't offer any help. First customer agent said pls send less money. Result:also unsuccessful. Second time - within 24hours an expert will contact you. Result: no help - no contact. The customer service is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!"
