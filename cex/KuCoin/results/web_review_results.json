                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

The challenging thing though is to navigate your way through the fully loaded platform which takes some time. Effort + Efficiency = $$$$$$Keep it up there humans!!! Please don't be in the news soon with legal issues. My heart will be broken."
