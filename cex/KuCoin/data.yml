history: "KuCoinâ€™s inception began with two tech-driven founders, Michael and Eric, who started coding and showed an early interest in blockchain technology. Their journey into cryptocurrency started in 2012 when Michael began mining Bitcoin after learning about it from Eric. The experience of using complex platforms like Mt. Gox inspired them to create a more user-friendly exchange. In 2013, they initiated KuCoin's development in a cafe, aiming to make the financial system more inclusive not just for the wealthy but for all global citizens, including the less educated and unbanked populations. This led to the establishment of KuCoin, branded as the \"People's Exchange\", which rapidly evolved into a significant global player in the crypto market with aspirations of impacting the industry on a large scale."
