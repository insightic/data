I deposited with Interac transfer a few days ago 3000 CAD into my Kraken account and received confirmation from both the bank and Interac that the money was collected. Ticket number #12566698. Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere!

I can understand that my initial proof of address was rejected as part of the verification, but it has been a nightmare ever since I tried to correct that. Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me. It seems creating an account works like clockwork, but deleting one is practically impossible."

The other assets went up roughly the same, so I made about 50% profit.There are alot of transanction fees and I didn't realise the \"earn\" function was sent to third parties for their profit. But overall I made a profit and got my money back, so am satisfied."

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange).

Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response.

It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions.

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange).

                "review": "Kraken support agents reply with incorrect information in their responses. Recently they have required customers to confirm their identity ( KYC ) and their using \"persona\" to upload your ID and video selfie. Well, after doing all the necessary steps, it still did not recognise my documents and I was locked out of my account. Upon contacting Kraken support, the first support person says their \"devs\" are working on it. No reply for 5 days after I write back telling them to unlock my account. Then I'm told by another support person that the selfie was not recognised and can I do it again. Now \"person\" asks for my ID again, which I already uploaded and for some reson it doesn't recognise my ID and can't take the pic. Then I contact customer support again for the 4th time and the latest person tells me to try on another device and that my address has changed. IT HAS NOT! Been living in the same address for over 5 years. What is going on with Kraken support members? Are they just copy and pastiing replies and not reading what the customer is asking? Are they trying to lose customers, because if they are, they are doing a great job at it! AND, don't even try to call them... there is no answer. Phone lines are closed!"

I have sent all required documents various times, got in contact with them and was told everything was fine and to wait. My account is completely legal, the funds are of transparent origin, all my paperwork is in order and I have complied every step of the way. Nevertheless, all of a sudden my access to the account and the funds has been cut off. I have no idea if kraken has illegally appropriated my funds or what is going on. Their support desk is completely unresponsive, complaints are not taken serious at all, in most cases not even answered. If you have an account there, close it, take your money and run. I regret deeply entrusting them with my money, big mistake"

Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere! Happy Halving Day (for Kraken, not investors)!Beware of this!"

Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me.

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."
