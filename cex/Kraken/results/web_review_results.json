                "review": "I have had a kraken account for years and all was fine, till some weeks ago a verification request came up. I have sent all required documents various times, got in contact with them and was told everything was fine and to wait. My account is completely legal, the funds are of transparent origin, all my paperwork is in order and I have complied every step of the way. Nevertheless, all of a sudden my access to the account and the funds has been cut off. I have no idea if kraken has illegally appropriated my funds or what is going on. Their support desk is completely unresponsive, complaints are not taken serious at all, in most cases not even answered. If you have an account there, close it, take your money and run. I regret deeply entrusting them with my money, big mistake"

Within a week I receive a notice that my account is being closed with no explanation \"due to security reasons\".   My mailing address is a PO Box in Massachusetts.  I submitted my electric bill as proof of address.  Duh, the mailing address on my mail is to the PO Box so of course proof shows the PO Box.   License shows physical address.  So I am not sure why the account was closed.  I was told to withdraw my initial deposited funds.  Money was returned.  Seems to me this is a \"business\" that does not want peoples business."

I deposited with Interac transfer a few days ago 3000 CAD into my Kraken account and received confirmation from both the bank and Interac that the money was collected. Ticket number #12566698. Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere! Happy Halving Day (for Kraken, not investors)!Beware of this!"

I can understand that my initial proof of address was rejected as part of the verification, but it has been a nightmare ever since I tried to correct that. Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me. It seems creating an account works like clockwork, but deleting one is practically impossible."

The other assets went up roughly the same, so I made about 50% profit.There are alot of transanction fees and I didn't realise the \"earn\" function was sent to third parties for their profit. But overall I made a profit and got my money back, so am satisfied."

                "review": "I would strongly advise against using Kraken. On April 4th, 2024, I transferred a significant amount of money into my Kraken account. As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Support, contacts and queries are passed along from 'agent's to 'agent's and never answered. Then the whole thing repeats again."

After the 72 hours have passed, your account will be closed.Kindly note that you cannot open another Kraken account. We may reach out to you if we require additional documentation.We appreciate your understanding.That's what they said, and looking at forums it's happening to a lot of people who are mystified as to why.A real shame, as the exchange is functionally good, but as for customer service, totally diabolical.STEER CLEAR"

On the same day, I transferred $5,000 (their bank took its commission) and bought 0.06799729 BTC. Kraken took their fee plus they probably converted dollars into euros at a rate known only to them. Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange). As a result I lost several hundred dollars. So avoid!"
