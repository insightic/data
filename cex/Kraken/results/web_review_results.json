I deposited with Interac transfer a few days ago 3000 CAD into my Kraken account and received confirmation from both the bank and Interac that the money was collected. Ticket number #12566698. Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere!

I can understand that my initial proof of address was rejected as part of the verification, but it has been a nightmare ever since I tried to correct that. Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me. It seems creating an account works like clockwork, but deleting one is practically impossible."

The other assets went up roughly the same, so I made about 50% profit.There are alot of transanction fees and I didn't realise the \"earn\" function was sent to third parties for their profit. But overall I made a profit and got my money back, so am satisfied."

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange).

I deposited with Interac transfer a few days ago 3000 CAD into my Kraken account and received confirmation from both the bank and Interac that the money was collected. Ticket number #12566698. Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere! Happy Halving Day (for Kraken, not investors)!Beware of this!"

Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me.

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange). As a result I lost several hundred dollars. So avoid!"
