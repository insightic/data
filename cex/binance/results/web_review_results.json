                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

They suggested me to report police but they are new to this and hard to handle this. It charges much fee as well. I don't want to make this complicate and hope to resolve without the help of local police.I hope someone from Binance or global law enforcement agency that can resolve this in a short period can contact me.Chat ID: #120805724, #120845562"

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

Besides this Binance is still the most liquid exchange with best limit execution and plenty of assets, way more than in comparison to the most. The API also allows for massive data transfer in order to be used with external apps, extremely performant. Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

                "review": "[Update] Case ID #121488440I feel compelled to share my experience with Binance in the hope of preventing others from falling victim to their deceptive practices. As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

Positive feedback emphasizes the trustworthiness of the service, reasonable fees, and a user-friendly interface, suggesting that many customers find the service reliable and easy to navigate with a cost structure they find acceptable. However, there are significant concerns raised by some users, with key phrases such as \"bad reviews,\" \"Scam Alert,\" \"stole my money,\" \"pending ticket,\" \"no follow-up,\" and \"verification system\" indicating issues with customer service, account access, and potentially the security or integrity of the service. The negative reviews suggest that the service may have problems with responsiveness to customer issues, particularly with regards to the verification process and account access. For improvement, the service should investigate these customer service complaints, enhance their verification system, and ensure better follow-up on support tickets to restore and maintain user trust.",

Actually they are adding new features everyday and really optimising their app and system. But it's all glitches. I would suggest you never ever head to copy trading feature it's gonna ruin all of your capital and everything. This feature is just to steal peoples money. When the lead trader opens a trade you get executed within 1-2 hours sometimes right before your first position is about to liquidate and also it never closes on its own even if the lead trade has closed right after opening the trade your position will stay opened no matter if it is in profits of thousands or in loses. Also let's say you followed a lead trader and when you started following him he already had a buy positioned opened at that time.Now what is gonna happen then is that whenever he is gonna close that position you are gonna enter into a short position.Also their support is really useless in these regards that they simply admit that this happened but never say that it's a system fault."

Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

And good luck trying to decipher their fee schedule \u2013 it's like navigating a maze designed to confuse and frustrate unsuspecting users.But the real kicker is their customer service \u2013 or lack thereof. It's like shouting into the void. When you encounter an issue, which you inevitably will, don't expect any timely resolution or even a semblance of human interaction. Binance's customer support is as responsive as a brick wall, leaving you stranded with your problems and your dwindling faith in humanity.And let's not forget about security \u2013 or the lack thereof. Binance has had its fair share of security breaches, leaving users vulnerable to hacks and theft. It's a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and you're left holding the bag when it inevitably does.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you enjoy financial frustration and existential dread. There are plenty of other cryptocurrency exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize transparency and security. Don't make the same mistake I did \u2013 run, don't walk, away from Binance. Your sanity and your bank account will thank you."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

Without any prior warning or valid explanation, they deactivated my account, leaving me completely stranded and unable to access my funds. This sudden and arbitrary action has caused me immense frustration and inconvenience.The lack of communication and transparency from Binance is unacceptable. I have been a loyal customer for quite some time, but this experience has shattered my trust in their platform. It is utterly irresponsible for a company to disable accounts without providing a clear reason or opportunity for resolution.I urge others to exercise caution when dealing with Binance. Their disregard for customer satisfaction and their apparent willingness to deactivate accounts without justification is concerning. I certainly will not be recommending Binance to anyone after this regrettable experience."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

                "review": "Binance, one of the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, prides itself on its efficient services and quick customer response times. However, recently, there has been a noticeable slowdown in their customer support department, leaving many users frustrated and dissatisfied.As a loyal Binance user for several years, I have always found their customer service to be top-notch. Any issues I encountered were swiftly resolved, and I could always count on a timely response from their team. So, when I found myself facing an unexpected problem with my account, I naturally turned to Binance for help.To my surprise, days passed with no response from their customer support team. I sent multiple messages through their website and social media channels, but all I received were automated responses assuring me that my inquiry was being looked into. Frustration began to set in as I watched my issue go unresolved, and I couldn't help but wonder what had caused this sudden delay in their usually prompt customer service.As more time passed, I started to see similar complaints from other users on online forums and social media platforms. Many were experiencing long wait times and delayed responses from Binance's support team, with some reporting that they had been waiting for weeks without any resolution to their problems.The once shining reputation of Binance's customer service was starting to tarnish, and users were becoming increasingly disillusioned with the exchange. Rumors began to circulate about possible internal issues within the company, causing the slowdown in customer support response times.Despite the setbacks, I remained hopeful that Binance would address the issue and restore their previous level of customer service excellence. As a valuable and loyal customer, I believed that they would do everything in their power to rectify the situation and regain the trust of their users.In the end, Binance did take steps to improve their customer support response times, hiring additional staff and implementing new systems to streamline their processes. The slowdown was eventually resolved, and once again, users could rely on Binance for efficient and effective customer service.Through this experience, I learned that even the most reliable and reputable companies can face challenges that affect their ability to provide top-notch service. It is during these times of struggle that true customer loyalty is tested, and I am pleased to say that Binance passed the test with flying colors in my book."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out.

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats.

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification.

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats. As for the order, just look at my last p2p transactions. its the last 2 both with the same guy. one cancelled where he just took the money and ran without you giving a damn you scum...the case ID for your inquiry is  123807477"

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

Even if u send money from your bank instantly, it takes binance at least 8 hours to process the transaction. That's extremely depressing for such a large casino."
