                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

They suggested me to report police but they are new to this and hard to handle this. It charges much fee as well. I don't want to make this complicate and hope to resolve without the help of local police.I hope someone from Binance or global law enforcement agency that can resolve this in a short period can contact me.Chat ID: #120805724, #120845562"

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

Besides this Binance is still the most liquid exchange with best limit execution and plenty of assets, way more than in comparison to the most. The API also allows for massive data transfer in order to be used with external apps, extremely performant. Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

                "review": "[Update] Case ID #121488440I feel compelled to share my experience with Binance in the hope of preventing others from falling victim to their deceptive practices. As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

The API also allows for massive data transfer in order to be used with external apps, extremely performant. Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

Customer support is noted to be responsive but often falls short in effectively resolving the issues raised by users, pointing to a need for improvement in customer service quality and problem resolution.
