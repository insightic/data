                "review": "I lost USDT from my wallet and deposit was made to Binance. I have been contacting Binance customer support team several times to refund money but they refuses to do it. Thief already agreed to refund and he had a chat with Binance to refund. But Binance refuses to do it. I don't know why they are making work too complicated. They suggested me to report police but they are new to this and hard to handle this. It charges much fee as well. I don't want to make this complicate and hope to resolve without the help of local police.I hope someone from Binance or global law enforcement agency that can resolve this in a short period can contact me.Chat ID: #120805724, #120845562"

So they blocked the incoming transfer for months, and I claimed it back from my bank.No matter how many times I have contacted support. Support is useless. they understand nothing."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

You can check from Google about this Ponzi scheme. It working on the same rule . So they take your money deposit easily even you are not verified.But forget that you get back your money ever. So if you want to throw away your money then give to binance as they are more poors then you they easily grab your money. I am scammed by Binance they have my money and now not giving me back . All the people you got scammed by them should share his/details because we should make a law suit against these Ponzi scheme scammers. They are accumulating the money and never returned as they are playing with greed of humans. Some day they will disappear with all your money. Please don't invest this shi*tty app you can also read down all reviews are against them. Every should write against their scamming in Google and play store as well . Because from play store more people are getting help as for to download binance shi*t. People who have some money please withdraw as soon as possible from Binance because they will run away with your money like happened with FTX and Luna Terra. Binance is second FTX as they are using Luna Terra address soon they will also disappear like Luna terra owner disappeared.So withdraw what ever you have in Binance as soon as possible."

Support is not professional and poorly trained. This is probably due to the fact that they get laid off every year so Binance can avoid paying out yearly bonuses.Do not put your money on this app."

                "review": "Clearly the best support I\u00b4ve seen so far. Besides this Binance is still the most liquid exchange with best limit execution and plenty of assets, way more than in comparison to the most. The API also allows for massive data transfer in order to be used with external apps, extremely performant. Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

                "review_title": "Avoid P2P trading and Binance in general!",
                "review": "Unfortunately as a UK resident we can seemingly no longer withdraw GBP/Fiat currency across most of not all exchanges (including Binance) due to FCA regulations. Unfortunately that leaves little option but to use a service like Binance P2P trading platform which is littered with blatant scammers. While Binance do provide an arbitrage service in the event a transaction isn't successful, unfortunately they seem marginally complicit in allowing thesescammers onto the platform and seemingly do very little about it. Additionally some of the advice Binance gives with regards chargeback scams is incorrect as the correct way to handle a chargeback if for the sellers bank to refund it, NOT for the seller to generate a separate payment as this is essentially doubling down on the risk of losing the funds as the original payment can still receive a chargeback, which is the advice Binance gave me. All in all I get the impression the scammers profit heavily from P2P platform as even advice like researching feedback is far from foolproof as this can easily be faked to skew/hide the negative one's that highlight the scam.Update: Originally this was a 3* Review, but having spent the past 2 days (and counting) defending my right to have the buyers payment manually sent via my Bank's Fraud department, I'm convinced Binance Customer Service are either complicit of clueless. During the appeals process I've had my account suspended, and get harassed every 4hrs to provide further information even though I've said numerous times nothing can be done until my bank opens Monday. Meanwhile the buyer/probable scammer messages like an impatient child with broken English the whole time. The whole system is a joke considering I raised the appeal yet I'm the one having to defend myself. At this stage I'm fearful Binance will just release the coins to the buyer and he'll raise a chargeback for the remainder. It would also appear that his account is seemingly unrestricted as he continues to operate. I WON'T EVER USE BINANCE AFTER THIS FARCE."

Amount paid thru UPI and deducted from bank account. Its one month we keep asking to release USDT but not yet released. It was reported to Binance after waiting 3 days but nothing happened.Its one month now, If we are going to report again or appeal, its Binance msg showing that you already reported and under process. I am not sure if the messages / conversation is good to be share on this plateform."

The thing is when I sold my usdt, it will appear according to the advert rate in USD. But this guys go against the binance rules buy telling that they don't buy USD. they only buy USDT.  This is very frustrating. Because I just lost my money on binance. Freeze any fraudulent account to teach them a lesson."

They also informed they I can't connect and one person has whole authority to reject and say your account is more accessible to you and it's in my hand.  If I say you cant make a withdrawal. Since pay 5L more above the 19 lakh Rupees. It's a very big amount as my home and family is suffering to another level.  I red about Biance and did not expect this . Unable to contact biance on the support chat as the link says unreachable. What do I do please help me I have full proof of the transactions and the screenshots ."

Yes, i also had some issues, but those were cause by my own lack of experiences with user interface and settings. Except that, i never had experienced any issues with trading on binance.In terms of Customer support. I had only and only great experiences. I remember one time, when i had to wait maybe 20 minutes, for CS employee to ask for a help his supervisor, but still comes back to me and solved my problem.Recently i noticed, that some part of UI, when you are tryin to withdraw your money in FIAT are a bit hard to orientate in, but still that is nothing to worry about...This is my experience."
