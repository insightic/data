margin_trading:
  details: "Whenever the maintenance margin of a user is higher than 100%, the liquidation process will start. During liquidation, open futures and open options positions can be closed and/or delta hedging can take place via perpetuals. It is within the discretion of Deribit risk management how to handle the user’s portfolio in an attempt to reduce the risk of bankruptcy. The liquidation process will look at the risk matrix to find which instrument is contributing the most to the margin and liquidate that instrument. If the attempted liquidation order does not trade (within certain safety parameters to not deviate too far from fair prices), then the algorithm will move to the next highest contributing instrument in the risk matrix. If attempts on the relevant instruments do not execute, then we will attempt to reduce the risk by delta hedging on the Perpetual (if this also reduces the maintenance margin). Note that we will always attempt to reduce instrument positions but the backup hedging using the Perpetual could result in opening or increasing an existing position there."
