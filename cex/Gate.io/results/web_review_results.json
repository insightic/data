To disable the function, please submit a ticket and contact customer support.\" I have immidiately created ticket #1182243. The support were only sending the default messages like i need to wait patiently and the team is working on my case. Then on 4th month of ticket they requested statements, proof of work and income. I had provided everything they have asked for.Later the error message was rephrased as \"Your account has been placed under protection due to detected potential risks. To lift this protection, please submit a ticket.\".Ticket is unsolved for 6 month already.Last reply from Gate.io in ticket was month ago. They are simply ignoring my messages or sending default one: The team is working on my issue and so on...6 months have passed but I still haven't any information about a reason of blocking, Gate.io havent explained anything.I have messaged Gate.io support via email, i had created topic on Reddit, i had messaged support in X(Twitter), tried to contact my manager via Telegram - nothing helped!!!"

Arbitrarily decline the verification and say they will freeze all assets within 7 days.They lie about tickets being submitted (say they are not from your own account so won't process them), refuse to allow transfers out below a certain amount, but say you will lose access unless you transfer your money out.Just totally geared up to steal money under the pretence of abiding by regulations (which they aren't).Update: the reply below is BS and not  reflective of how these scammers are operating. I already did KYC when I opened the account. They've asked for a new address verification, which I provided. Their response was simply that it had failed and my assets would be frozen in 7 days. Nothing about another way to verify, and no way to remove funds. Submitted a ticket. They lied when I followed up and said the ticket wasn't submitted from my account. Provided further evidence...

Once you passed that threshold, they block your withdraws in the state of \"verifying\" which is when they ask you to send them some documents to prove your identity, bank account statement blabla and thats where they never answer your emails or requests or tickets properly and keep you in this blocked state till forever no matter how much you contact them. They constantly say we will get back to you, we will review it, or they just send some irrelevant automated answers. Even these unhelpful responses each takes 1,2 days at least for you to receive which again keeps you in such blocked state forever. Its been few weeks so far and although I have sent them even more documents than what they have asked, but still no supports from them I have received. Their online chat support person tells you sth like \"oh we are so sorry, I will escalate this to our review team/ senior team blabla\" which never ever did a thing to my case and nobody got back to me. Complete scam. Avoid for sure. I'm going to claim my monies back from my credit card support as I have proof of all my communications with them already."

Arbitrarily decline the verification and say they will freeze all assets within 7 days.They lie about tickets being submitted (say they are not from your own account so won't process them), refuse to allow transfers out below a certain amount, but say you will lose access unless you transfer your money out.Just totally geared up to steal money under the pretence of abiding by regulations (which they aren't).Update: the reply below is BS and not  reflective of how these scammers are operating. I already did KYC when I opened the account. They've asked for a new address verification, which I provided. Their response was simply that it had failed and my assets would be frozen in 7 days. Nothing about another way to verify, and no way to remove funds. Submitted a ticket. They lied when I followed up and said the ticket wasn't submitted from my account. Provided further evidence...

They constantly say we will get back to you, we will review it, or they just send some irrelevant automated answers. Even these unhelpful responses each takes 1,2 days at least for you to receive which again keeps you in such blocked state forever. Its been few weeks so far and although I have sent them even more documents than what they have asked, but still no supports from them I have received. Their online chat support person tells you sth like \"oh we are so sorry, I will escalate this to our review team/ senior team blabla\" which never ever did a thing to my case and nobody got back to me.

The fact that I want to withdraw more assets in the near future is what makes it even more terrifying for me. What in other platforms takes seconds in Gate.io takes probably (? not resolved yet) more that a week (at least) and many messages.Edit: They resolved the issue!Thanks"

Since this update I have chased up and given the same automated response stating the team are yet to pick this up. To confirm this has now been going on for 4 months and still not resolved.

Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

Now 2 months on, the live chat now tell me \u2018they cannot help me anymore, the only way to contact the team on my case is to email them\u2019 - I EMAILED THEM 10/15 TIMES OVER THE PAST 4/6 WEEKS WITH NO REPLY/ NO UPDATE. So I\u2019m basically just being ignored while they have my money. I\u2019ve filled out the same questionnaire they asked for about 3 times. I\u2019ve sent them every bit of my life. And now they just say they can\u2019t help me. Im exhausted. I\u2019m depressed. I\u2019m struggling as I have a massive loan to pay. I am at a wall with this company. This is a serious amount of money for me that they have just taken from me and won\u2019t release. Do I need to say any more? I would advise to stay away at all costs , I don\u2019t wish this on anyone . And looking through reviews on this and other websites , this is happening FAR TO OFTEN. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. Ticket number 1081360 ."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Unbelievable Now I got message that I can't trade the USDt I bought on p2p for 24 hrs . The customer service doesn't know why. My experience not good with them . Update 1 they have even blocked my withdrawal. Working on bybit kucoin HTX as merchant I never faced such issues. My  2nd day as merchant and I already have so many issues on gate.ioIssue solved.

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

I hold my hands up and say I sent SHX tokens without a memo. Funds have now been held with Gate.io. I have provided all the requested documents and transaction information for funds to be returned. The updates the support team have given me:\u2022 The case is now with our tech team\u2022 The transfer has to be processed manually so is with the specialized team\u2022 They are really busy and request will be picked up as and whenTheses are just a few of the reasons. Most time don\u2019t even em get a response. Let me break this down another way. Believe it or not I don\u2019t this the same mistake on Uphold exchange. They resolves the matter within 48 hours. So easy for them to locate and return payment. This has been going on since November 2023. I can not believe they are just holding my money for no apparent reason. I am seeking legal advise to understand how I can have my funds returned as at this point I feel this exchange gate.io are really suspicious and would advise to stay away for simply to avoid such stress and mental health reasons. The ticket I raised is 1256841 is still not resolved. The last update was manual transaction process takes time so I just got to sit and wait. God knows how long for.

This is ridiculous, how long does it take for their \"specialist\" to figure this out. This is absurd, my friend has missed out on profits, I have missed on profits as I also made a txn to my binance, and it too under review, wanted to deposit more money.

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

I hold my hands up and say I sent SHX tokens without a memo. Funds have now been held with Gate.io. I have provided all the requested documents and transaction information for funds to be returned. The updates the support team have given me:\u2022 The case is now with our tech team\u2022 The transfer has to be processed manually so is with the specialized team\u2022 They are really busy and request will be picked up as and whenTheses are just a few of the reasons. Most time don\u2019t even em get a response. Let me break this down another way. Believe it or not I don\u2019t this the same mistake on Uphold exchange. They resolves the matter within 48 hours. So easy for them to locate and return payment. This has been going on since November 2023. I can not believe they are just holding my money for no apparent reason. I am seeking legal advise to understand how I can have my funds returned as at this point I feel this exchange gate.io are really suspicious and would advise to stay away for simply to avoid such stress and mental health reasons. The ticket I raised is 1256841 is still not resolved. The last update was manual transaction process takes time so I just got to sit and wait. God knows how long for. Please can I have some kind of a specialist from gate.io who actually knows what they are doing to review my ticket 1256841."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3. Still feel customer service is poor and beware if you are from a restricted country."

I have the email and phone number and password, but when it comes to Authenticator I am stuck there. I tried to reset my Authenticator and also contact customer service. Request 1284933.  Now 10 days nothing happen. I am wondering now is it reliable to depend on gate.io or no?? They reply me they will check. Still hoe many days nothing happen.. I believe it's gate.io is fraud.. I don't advise anybody to use"
