It keep asking about questions you can't really answer (like detail of transaction) if you just opened a small account you almost forgot. I mean here i am with pictures they asked, with writings and poses plus id picture but no luck. It seems they will intentionally keep your lost account for themselves.Will change rating if #1317959 resolved. It's beyond horrible."

I have sent over 40 replies and all the documents they requested but the issue has not resolved yet. The fact that I want to withdraw more assets in the near future is what makes it even more terrifying for me. What in other platforms takes seconds in Gate.io takes probably (? not resolved yet) more that a week (at least) and many messages.Edit: They resolved the issue!Thanks"

Any opportunity to buy, sell, withdraw were disabled.The error was \"The system has detected a security risk with your account, so we have activated the account fund protection function for you. To disable the function, please submit a ticket and contact customer support.\" I have immidiately created ticket #1182243. The support were only sending the default messages like i need to wait patiently and the team is working on my case. Then on 4th month of ticket they requested statements, proof of work and income. I had provided everything they have asked for.Later the error message was rephrased as \"Your account has been placed under protection due to detected potential risks. To lift this protection, please submit a ticket.\".Ticket is unsolved for 6 month already.Last reply from Gate.io in ticket was month ago. They are simply ignoring my messages or sending default one: The team is working on my issue and so on...6 months have passed but I still haven't any information about a reason of blocking, Gate.io havent explained anything.I have messaged Gate.io support via email, i had created topic on Reddit, i had messaged support in X(Twitter), tried to contact my manager via Telegram - nothing helped!!!"

Arbitrarily decline the verification and say they will freeze all assets within 7 days.They lie about tickets being submitted (say they are not from your own account so won't process them), refuse to allow transfers out below a certain amount, but say you will lose access unless you transfer your money out.Just totally geared up to steal money under the pretence of abiding by regulations (which they aren't).Update: the reply below is BS and not  reflective of how these scammers are operating. I already did KYC when I opened the account. They've asked for a new address verification, which I provided. Their response was simply that it had failed and my assets would be frozen in 7 days. Nothing about another way to verify, and no way to remove funds. Submitted a ticket. They lied when I followed up and said the ticket wasn't submitted from my account. Provided further evidence... Silence."

Once you passed that threshold, they block your withdraws in the state of \"verifying\" which is when they ask you to send them some documents to prove your identity, bank account statement blabla and thats where they never answer your emails or requests or tickets properly and keep you in this blocked state till forever no matter how much you contact them. They constantly say we will get back to you, we will review it, or they just send some irrelevant automated answers. Even these unhelpful responses each takes 1,2 days at least for you to receive which again keeps you in such blocked state forever. Its been few weeks so far and although I have sent them even more documents than what they have asked, but still no supports from them I have received. Their online chat support person tells you sth like \"oh we are so sorry, I will escalate this to our review team/ senior team blabla\" which never ever did a thing to my case and nobody got back to me. Complete scam. Avoid for sure. I'm going to claim my monies back from my credit card support as I have proof of all my communications with them already."
