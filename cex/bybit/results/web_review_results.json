Unfortunately, after asking me to send over some personal information with pictures and a video, I haven't heard anything from the support team. Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."
