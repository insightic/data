Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."

It's been almost 2 weeks.I never got the amount from any of the buyers since. I appeal with uploading the video every single time. But all the five times the appeal is cancelled. What do I need to do to return my money back already? Can't you just cancel or close the deal by yourself? The buyer doesn't even read or login since. Definitely not a behaviour of a person, who sent his money. UPDIT WAS CANCELLED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!WITH NO ASKING FOR ANYTHING, NO CHECKING THE PROOF, NO ADDITIONAL \"PLEASE SHOW US MORE PROOF\". NO. JUST CANCELLED. 6TH DAMN TIME. OMG. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

                "review": "Bybit is hands down the most untrustworthy exchange I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I am in Taiwan. My credit card name is in English. My ID (which was used for the KYC) is in Chinese. They won't let you enter your name in Chinese when adding the card. Thus when it goes to process the transaction it fails because the name on the ID and the card don't match. KYC is supposed to be used to prevent money laundering. This purchase is for less than $100 US. I am sure money launderers are making $100 deposits (/sarc) . There should be a threshhold above a certain amount  where KYC has to be used."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."
