Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."

It's been almost 2 weeks.I never got the amount from any of the buyers since. I appeal with uploading the video every single time. But all the five times the appeal is cancelled. What do I need to do to return my money back already? Can't you just cancel or close the deal by yourself? The buyer doesn't even read or login since. Definitely not a behaviour of a person, who sent his money. UPDIT WAS CANCELLED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!WITH NO ASKING FOR ANYTHING, NO CHECKING THE PROOF, NO ADDITIONAL \"PLEASE SHOW US MORE PROOF\". NO. JUST CANCELLED. 6TH DAMN TIME. OMG. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

                "review": "Bybit is hands down the most untrustworthy exchange I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I am in Taiwan. My credit card name is in English. My ID (which was used for the KYC) is in Chinese. They won't let you enter your name in Chinese when adding the card. Thus when it goes to process the transaction it fails because the name on the ID and the card don't match. KYC is supposed to be used to prevent money laundering. This purchase is for less than $100 US. I am sure money launderers are making $100 deposits (/sarc) . There should be a threshhold above a certain amount  where KYC has to be used."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever.

BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement.

I provided the Txid and a video of transfer to the bybit support team. Now it has been over 3 months and I keep receiving the same generic email of providing the TXID which I sent them multiple times. I really do not know what else is required and I am waiting since 3 months now and I do see any funds that has been transferred back!"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

BYSCAM unlocked the sellers USDT despite receiving all the evidence of the scam. The seller has then went on to try to scam others but unfortunately for them the respective buyers became aware of the intentions. Woukdnt be suorised if the seller is an employee of BYSCAM as they have been able to scam and recover funds awhile the account has been restricted.I have send 10+ emails to BYSCAM with all the information relating to the case and the evidence of the scam. BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement. It would seem that Bybit is bend on destruction of their brand and to steal as much funds as possible from its customers.Until Bybit sort their stuff out PLEASE PLEASE get your money of the platform and inform everyone who may be effected by their dishonesty.BYBIT = THEIVES"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

Despite multiple attempts to contact customer support through email, social media, and their support channels, I have received no response. This delay is causing significant financial stress. I expected better support from a platform with such a high trust rating. Please address this issue as soon as possible.Thank you, Bybit Customer Service Team, for resolving my previous P2P appeal promptly after I reached out on various platforms. However, I have another order currently under appeal that has been pending for a long time (Order ID: 1781339545354534912, Amount: 36.90 EUR).

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

Despite reaching out on multiple platforms, my P2P appeal remains unresolved.Details:- Order ID: 1781339545354534912- Amount: 36.90 EUR- Total USDT: 40.1087- Reason for Appeal: My order was canceled even though I have made the payment.Why do I need to constantly bombard Bybit on every possible platform for them to do their job? It is disgraceful to call yourself a crypto exchange when your support is non-existent. Taking users' money to inflate trading volumes and then failing to provide proper support is a disgrace.Furthermore, I am appalled that CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which are considered reputable rating agencies, have given Bybit a perfect 10/10 rating. My trust in these platforms is severely undermined. How can an exchange in 2024 have a trust score of 10/10 when its support operates at 0?This level of service is unacceptable and a black mark on the reputation of both Bybit and the rating agencies that endorse them.Bybit, you need to step up and resolve this issue immediately."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Please help for the love of God all my money and my family's money are all in my bybit account and it's so bad to feel like all my funds are frozen just because of $200. They said it would be resolved within 8 days but it still continues. At only 22 years old, I've placed all my hopes and my family's future in Bybit.I'm 22 years old. My father is retired and I deposited my father's money into my Bybit account. I worked all my life and put all my money into my Bybit account. Both my family's money and all my money are in my bybit account. Because I had full confidence in bybit. I cannot support my household because all my money is tied to Bybit.Case ID: 10006306 andUID: 75419275"

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Bybit stated that I needed to submit some documents for KYC verification. They assured me that they would respond within 48 hours, but it has now been more than 10 days and I have not received any response. During this time, I have reached out to their support multiple times, but there has been complete radio silence. My assets are essentially stuck, and I have no way of accessing them. This experience has been incredibly frustrating and stressful. I cannot trust a platform that handles issues in such an unprofessional manner.

                "review": "Case ID: 09810204Bybit UID: 121119390I recently contacted Bybit's support team to relinquish my status as a P2P Merchant and to release my frozen funds amounting to 1000 USD. Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

After the first deposit, that was smooth, I decided to move my money to Bybit exchange. Unfortunately I am the one like many others, who's deposit is flagged for many days with no contact with support, any explanation or apology. I have done two times deposit 10000 Euro each. After more than a week I have the only one case opened that is under review. The second 10000 Euro deposit looks like is floating in space. In my opinion does not matter how good Bybit is, if my hard earned money are kept with no time limits. Personally I do not give up with Bybit and I will wait for the end of my case. For sure I will not deposit more money as long as my trust is ruined.Tip for Bybit's representativesUAB Onlychain Fintech Limited is responsible for verifications. If they can not make it in declared 48 h, deposits should be automatically rejected and money should be returned or deposit should be bypassed and transferred to account. The issues that are caused by UAB Onlychain Fintech are destroying the whole reputation of Bybit and all purnished efforts of creating good exchange website are lost.With greetingsMarta Rz."

I sent all the videos requested the buyer on the other hand did not send any proof of payment. However, after two the buyer finally accepted that he did not make the payment and the bank had also placed a freeze on his bank account. he has now asked the appeal officer to cancel the trade and return my coins. I have not heard from the appeal for two weeks now. I submitted a case No: 10275617to my utter dismay, this case was closed without ever looking into the case.

In most polite way, I asked bank provider and company responsible for verification for returning my founds - of course I did not receive any answer. I see only \"copy/past\" messages. As I client I feel that I have no right to ask about anything, no right to be ensured that everything is ok, that my money are save, that after verification I will be able to withdraw assets and I will not have to experience delays, that documents that I will send are save and how can I protect documents from any risk. Bybit team, I do not see any way to contact with You. I am forced to blindly follow the windows that appear on screen, I feel like I have no rights as a customer.Dear Bybit Team, on the other side are real people, who as a Your customers deserves more than a bot or copy/past messages.I am tired and I will have to accept psychological blackmail that I am experiencing. It is very upsetting that I can expect no attention and any real answer.With regardsMarta Rz."

Potential areas for further investigation include deeper exploration of stablecoins' role in the market and the long-term impacts of Bitcoin halving on various stakeholders.",

If not for Nigeria banning binance p2p, why would I use bybit in the first place.A buyer send money using different accounts name from registered account name with bybit and I refund the money, the buyer report as scam and bybit without investigation or checking our conversation restrict my account, I message the support with p2p chat and all screenshot of the transfer but no response. The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

They don\u2019t ask anything whatsoever. And to make it even worse the refund takes 7 to 14 days to be refunded? How is this even possible? How does it take it so long first to deny a deposit, second to be refunded and third that there is no way of contacting them directly.  This is such a bad and poor customer service. I need my money and now I am obligated to wait more than 3 weeks counting the 5 days that already have past to see my money back? It\u2019s unbelievable."

The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Now I believe the are stealing the money.I find KYC procedures tedious, but I understand they must observe them by law.

Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Now I believe the are stealing the money.I find KYC procedures tedious, but I understand they must observe them by law. Even accepting this, the correct way should have been to REJECT MY DEPOSIT - ASK FOR DOCUMENTS - THEN ALLOW FOR THE MONEY TO BE DEPOSITED. Insted they took my money, then they froze it arbitrarily."

One time they froze my money asking for documents proving the income and my ID document (which they already had).Then I made some more transfers.Last Friday I made a big 10.000$ transfer. The money arrived on bybit, then I bought usdt with it.After that, they blocked my usdt asking again for the same info they already had.I immediately submitted the documents and waited the 48hours they delcared were needed for the review.After 80 hours nothing had happened, and they were UNREACHABLE via customer support.I found a good soul on instagram who answered me and promised they would have expedited the procedure. Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Finally at total of 136 HOURS (not promised 48) I got my money unblocked.The correct way should have been to REJECT MY DEPOSIT - ASK FOR DOCUMENTS - THEN ALLOW FOR THE MONEY TO BE DEPOSITED. Instead they took my money, then they froze it arbitrarily.ALSO: I have a p2p order which was fraudulent. The appeal was to no avail and AS USUAL, NO CUSTOMER SEVICE.

This has caused a restriction on my account from both p2p and withdrawal, I have filed a dispute on the order on Sunday 7th July and an email came in later Sunday evening saying a resolution is already reached and my appeal closed. They said my frozen assets will be released soon but nothing yet, I\u2019m still restricted from withdrawal and p2p.  Pls I need help with this right now.

You file dispute and you just see your dispute being cancelled , meanwhile the buyer goes completely quite and despite the moderator seeing that you\u2019re the only one begging and telling them you were not paid they still cancel and exit chat . I have my money stucked in 2 different trades now . Reached out to email support over a week ago , ticket created but no actual response . They don\u2019t respond on social media either . Worst customer service and support .Can\u2019t even upload video of proof while in appeal because it won\u2019t upload , Then how are you meant to submit proof ? I am not sure this site would not be top site in the new few years , it just sucks compared to binance .Look into my order and get my coined that was locked released because the buyers did not pay.Infact one of the orders the buyer clearly stated he did not pay , I did an appeal and what did the moderator do ??? Cancel appeal .What a big joke .Transaction order ID 1811533506964533248Transaction order ID 1807353960805875712My UID 150207814Apeal and release my coin for both trades .Anybody could just come to the site , mark trade as paid and delete the app on their phone while the other party has to suffer .

My issues with order disputes, related to order numbers 1810413416543465472, 1809984123983331328, and 1809962479753895936, remain unresolved for days.My assets have been frozen for an extended period, and the users involved are unresponsive. The lack of support and guidance from the Bybit team has made an already frustrating situation even more distressing.I urgently request that my matter be highlighted and resolved as soon as possible. I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience. I hope Bybit improves its support system to assist users more effectively.Until then, I would caution users to be aware of the potential difficulties in resolving issues with this platform.Please help me resolve this matter urgently.My UID: 159061149"

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it. So, If you want your deposit to be frozen without any reason and support completely ignoring you, then this exchange is for you.Hopefully bybit representative will see it and resolve this issue.

I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience.

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it.

I need the restriction on my account lifted so I can continue with my trades.UID - 148879762Case Number - #10776147Order ID - 1808590085422477312"

My issues with order disputes, related to order numbers 1810413416543465472, 1809984123983331328, and 1809962479753895936, remain unresolved for days.My assets have been frozen for an extended period, and the users involved are unresponsive. The lack of support and guidance from the Bybit team has made an already frustrating situation even more distressing.I urgently request that my matter be highlighted and resolved as soon as possible. I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience. I hope Bybit improves its support system to assist users more effectively.Until then, I would caution users to be aware of the potential difficulties in resolving issues with this platform.Please help me resolve this matter urgently.My UID: 159061149"

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it. So, If you want your deposit to be frozen without any reason and support completely ignoring you, then this exchange is for you.Hopefully bybit representative will see it and resolve this issue.

When I tried to withdraw the fiat funds (a 3 figure \u20ac amount) Bybit suddenly required KYC Lv. 2 verification to process the request. This, bybit had never done before. Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"

When I tried to withdraw the fiat funds (a 3 figure \u20ac amount) Bybit suddenly required KYC Lv. 2 verification to process the request. This, bybit had never done before. Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"

There is no way to talk to a real person from technical support. It feels like the company doesn't care about its customers at all.Terrible experience!I hope that my problem will be solved soon and I will switch to another platform."

When I tried to withdraw the fiat funds (a 3 figure \u20ac amount) Bybit suddenly required KYC Lv. 2 verification to process the request. This, bybit had never done before. Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"
