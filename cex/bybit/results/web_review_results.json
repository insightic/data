Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."

It's been almost 2 weeks.I never got the amount from any of the buyers since. I appeal with uploading the video every single time. But all the five times the appeal is cancelled. What do I need to do to return my money back already? Can't you just cancel or close the deal by yourself? The buyer doesn't even read or login since. Definitely not a behaviour of a person, who sent his money. UPDIT WAS CANCELLED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!WITH NO ASKING FOR ANYTHING, NO CHECKING THE PROOF, NO ADDITIONAL \"PLEASE SHOW US MORE PROOF\". NO. JUST CANCELLED. 6TH DAMN TIME. OMG. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

                "review": "Bybit is hands down the most untrustworthy exchange I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I am in Taiwan. My credit card name is in English. My ID (which was used for the KYC) is in Chinese. They won't let you enter your name in Chinese when adding the card. Thus when it goes to process the transaction it fails because the name on the ID and the card don't match. KYC is supposed to be used to prevent money laundering. This purchase is for less than $100 US. I am sure money launderers are making $100 deposits (/sarc) . There should be a threshhold above a certain amount  where KYC has to be used."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever.

BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement.

I provided the Txid and a video of transfer to the bybit support team. Now it has been over 3 months and I keep receiving the same generic email of providing the TXID which I sent them multiple times. I really do not know what else is required and I am waiting since 3 months now and I do see any funds that has been transferred back!"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

BYSCAM unlocked the sellers USDT despite receiving all the evidence of the scam. The seller has then went on to try to scam others but unfortunately for them the respective buyers became aware of the intentions. Woukdnt be suorised if the seller is an employee of BYSCAM as they have been able to scam and recover funds awhile the account has been restricted.I have send 10+ emails to BYSCAM with all the information relating to the case and the evidence of the scam. BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement. It would seem that Bybit is bend on destruction of their brand and to steal as much funds as possible from its customers.Until Bybit sort their stuff out PLEASE PLEASE get your money of the platform and inform everyone who may be effected by their dishonesty.BYBIT = THEIVES"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

Despite multiple attempts to contact customer support through email, social media, and their support channels, I have received no response. This delay is causing significant financial stress. I expected better support from a platform with such a high trust rating. Please address this issue as soon as possible.Thank you, Bybit Customer Service Team, for resolving my previous P2P appeal promptly after I reached out on various platforms. However, I have another order currently under appeal that has been pending for a long time (Order ID: 1781339545354534912, Amount: 36.90 EUR).

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

                "review": "I am writing to express my utter frustration and disappointment with Bybit's customer support. Despite reaching out on multiple platforms, my P2P appeal remains unresolved.Details:- Order ID: 1781339545354534912- Amount: 36.90 EUR- Total USDT: 40.1087- Reason for Appeal: My order was canceled even though I have made the payment.Why do I need to constantly bombard Bybit on every possible platform for them to do their job? It is disgraceful to call yourself a crypto exchange when your support is non-existent. Taking users' money to inflate trading volumes and then failing to provide proper support is a disgrace.Furthermore, I am appalled that CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which are considered reputable rating agencies, have given Bybit a perfect 10/10 rating. My trust in these platforms is severely undermined. How can an exchange in 2024 have a trust score of 10/10 when its support operates at 0?This level of service is unacceptable and a black mark on the reputation of both Bybit and the rating agencies that endorse them.Bybit, you need to step up and resolve this issue immediately."

I need to do P2P exchange urgently, their live support told me 7 hours ago it will be credited in couple of hours but after 9 hours still nothing. BYBIT is becoming worst than it was before. Will switch to another platform after this because connecting live support after waiting 20 minutes in 2024 is unacceptable. Also my case \"EXC1795160106951315456\" has not been solved for 3 business days. Really annoying platform.

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."
