So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

If you would like to download your transaction history for tax reasons you have to KYC take a photo of yourself holding a piece a paper stating what u want. Any other exchange has api where u can access data anytime. Risky sending your personal data to the cloud everytime you want to prepare your tax returns"

I need my full transaction history (which should be really small/short) for tax purposes and requested my trade history from them. It says they get back to you within 5 business days; well, tough luck. I'm still waiting. If there's any update to this, I'll change my rating accordingly."

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

On the positive side, users commend the app for its security and ease of use, suggesting that the app's infrastructure for protecting user data and facilitating transactions is appreciated. However, the negative aspects overshadow these positives, with many users experiencing significant frustration due to technical problems and service quality. For potential improvement, the app developers should prioritize enhancing the user interface, streamlining account access, and bolstering customer support to address the key concerns and improve overall user satisfaction.",
