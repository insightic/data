My coins are locked by a scammer from last 2 months and scammer confirmed in the order chat that he has provided fake receipt, still the support asking to the scammer if he can cancel the order or not. Useless support. Stay away from such rubbish platform."

Before I startedi checked the crypto currencies tradedon the exchange and saw that they were trading the ones i have had and deposited the currency, in this case Super RARE in a quite expensive way too. But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

If you would like to download your transaction history for tax reasons you have to KYC take a photo of yourself holding a piece a paper stating what u want. Any other exchange has api where u can access data anytime. Risky sending your personal data to the cloud everytime you want to prepare your tax returns"

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

They want documents of ID and screenshots and pictures, and too much hassle just to withdraw money you deposited.
