                "review": "I have same problem as everyone, they stopped withdrawals for me because I deposited and immediately withdrawed funds. It\u2019s not a very big sum, 500 dollars, but still, they asked me to provide huge pack of documents, screenshots, etc. So I did, 6 weeks passed since then. The support stopped responding to my emails a month ago. Looks like think goes bad for them, if they scam people in so dumb way. I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t make a larger deposit. Do not trust them, all good reviews are written by their marketing team. I wish I had read the reviews, before I used that scam exchange."

It was an absolute impudence, in the past there were no problems at all... I am supposed to provide evidence from 2013-2015, which is impossible. I have a basic+ verification and should supposedly be able to pay out, but after about 20x trys I gave up. I hope there will be a class action lawsuit at some point. I don't believe I'll get my money back anymore. It's an impudence like I've never experienced on a crypto exchange. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!"

I transfered $MATIC coin from Binance and never received it, contacted support teams and it has been under review for ages. It seems never resolving. If you still join Bitfinex trust me it is going to be worst one you will come across. I should have checked the reviews before dealing with Bitfinex"

Customer service is not very helpful either. I'd say stay away, there's already enough risk associated with Cryptocurrecy, you wouldn't want added risk because of Bitfinex. The user interface is also far inferior to their counterparts such as Coinbase and Ndax."

Also i don't where did they find the support but never, never experienced such a disrespectful \"support\" saying that i am a liar. Few years ago i helped to creat an account to mother. No issue paying them money but few months ago after she wanted to learn something for her old days its just impossible because she coudnlt send her selfie with handwrited justification with a high resolution(but clear and visible) also i had to translator everything because she's older French lady and don't speek english. This is just crazy, they pretend to be a great exchange blablabla but the support is simply rude, the rules just changed not even giving a chance to adapt. Really can't recommend. Just stick to your ledger guya"
