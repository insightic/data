The support stopped responding to my emails a month ago. Looks like think goes bad for them, if they scam people in so dumb way. I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t make a larger deposit.

This is just crazy, they pretend to be a great exchange blablabla but the support is simply rude, the rules just changed not even giving a chance to adapt. Really can't recommend.

I have a basic+ verification and should supposedly be able to pay out, but after about 20x trys I gave up. I hope there will be a class action lawsuit at some point. I don't believe I'll get my money back anymore. It's an impudence like I've never experienced on a crypto exchange. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!"

No issue paying them money but few months ago after she wanted to learn something for her old days its just impossible because she coudnlt send her selfie with handwrited justification with a high resolution(but clear and visible) also i had to translator everything because she's older French lady and don't speek english. This is just crazy, they pretend to be a great exchange blablabla but the support is simply rude, the rules just changed not even giving a chance to adapt. Really can't recommend. Just stick to your ledger guya"

However, the prevalence of negative reviews, with an average rating of 2.2, points to widespread user dissatisfaction, particularly due to technical problems and poor customer service experiences. Critical issues such as account access barriers and subpar interface performance are major sources of frustration for users, overshadowing the app's positive aspects. For improvement, the app developers should prioritize enhancing the user interface, streamlining account access processes, and bolstering customer support to address the concerns and potentially improve overall user satisfaction.",
