They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They will self-govern and self-sustain.\n\n9) Scope Frameworks: Outlines the constitutional subcomponents that contain unambiguous rulesets, process definitions, instructions, and incentives that cover all operations.\n\n10) List of Scope Framework Constitutional Boundaries: Outlines the range of work that MakerDAO contributors should concentrate on to improve the content that, after enough iterations, will define the scopes of MakerDAO.\n\n11) Maker Constitution Amendment Process: Defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs for the purposes of implementing Endgame.\n\nThe Maker Constitution vote ends on Monday, March 27th.\n\n\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0fhttps://lnkd.in/eRbaWn3g",
